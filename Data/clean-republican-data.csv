3593,"few things, and this is more from the prop side that i think a lot of the article seems to gloss over first off it is not the responsibility of the actor to check the gun. it is the job of the prop master or in the case of guns, the armorer to handle that. second, the gun was an old style revolver and the shot was a close up, so dummy rounds would be used. dummy rounds look just like real bullets, only they don t fire as they have no gunpowder. third, in the proper set up, the prop master would bring a gun, unloaded, and six or the proper number needed of dummy bullets. they would, in front of the assistant director, or whoever is directly in charge of the scene, will show the gun is empty, stick a rod through the barrel to show its empty, then hand the director the dummy bullets, who would then check each bullet by shaking it. dummy bullets are filled with bb s instead of powder . they would load the gun and then hand it to the actor. instead, the first assistant grabbed a gun off a cart, which should have been in the control of the prop master or armorer, and handed it to baldwin. now, as for my basic understanding of the law, looking at how this all fell apart before baldwin came into play, he can and should be held accountable in civil case as he was a producer, as it s his money that lead to this. as for criminal charges? no. any other actor, or producer, would not be held accountable. the closest case they could pull is he knew of issues with safety before hand, but that s not enough for a criminal charge. if you went to a gun range, and the range master told you the gun he s handing you is safe, but there s a blockage and it blows up in your hand, blame doesn t get passed to you, and it s the range master who is responsible for that as it s reasonable to assume the range master is credible and would have checked the gun. the moment the first assistant director broke protocol and handed baldwin the gun, it became the responsibility of the fad and the prop master for negligence.",9,395

5005,"per your own source, the doctor said that people shouldn't take the livestock form of the drug. we all agree on that. he also said that he has seen people who have taken ivermectin go onto ventilators from covid, which likely means the drug isn't a silver bullet to cure covid. we probably agree on that too. the only single line of your article is the same doctor saying he saw a patient who had taken the horse formulation, and is being treated. this is called anecdotal evidence, and is not indicative that people are taking horse dewormer. there's likely more people hospitalized from eating tide pods than taking dewormer. with all of that said, there is a human form of ivermectin that is widely prescribed to millions of people every year. it is a safe and cheap fda approved drug. it's efficacy on treating covid is unknown at best. so we can agree that people shouldn't take horse dewormer, but it's worth noting that this isn't anything more than media clickbait.",2,172

9717,pretty sure they're looking at homicides year to date relative to homicides prior year to date still not an 800 increase though . it doesn't make sense to compare an annualized number to this year so far.,2,37

9746,"biden was referencing urban murder rates with that quote? dude okay, biden bad, i get it, but at least try logic, y know? this is just baseless partisan fearmongering, and the weakest attempt at whataboutism i ve seen in quite some time.",2,42
9748,"yeah, that s what i m talking about. biden frequently spoke about the negative impact of trump s rhetoric and hypocrisy. he was right to do so there are a number of examples of trump s words leading to violence, and his hypocrisy was mind blowing. you re deflecting again. what policies, or even statements, do you feel associates biden with the numbers you posted?",2,65
9751,"and you accused the last guy of deflection? wow. okay, i ll bite, when did biden say that trump policies increased murder rates? i remember him talking about how trump s irresponsible rhetoric telling his supporters to attack people, telling them he d pay for their legal fees, etc could lead to violence, but i don t recall him pointing to policies. i also don t recall biden instructing his supporters to inflict violence. do you have anything to base any kind of argument on, or is this just biden bad! partisan shilling?",2,93
9754,what biden policies do you blame for the increase in murder rates in these cities?,2,15
9760,"you re arguing that police retirements and resignations are responsible for the crime increases in these cities, and not the general reopening of the country, and you re also saying that the burden of proof lies with me? you re throwing out national numbers, and i m talking about specific cities, in specific states, with high vaccine adoption rates. did the retirements you re bringing up happen in these cities? even by a greater number than in other towns or cities? do you want me to prove that more people have been vaccinated in less time in 2021 than in 2020? listen, i get it. you want joe biden and the left to have somehow caused this with negative policies, you don t want this to be the natural result of sudden increased public activity; i m just pointing out that you have nothing to support that except that you feel like it should be true. the difference in homicide type matters because gang violence as one example these are densely populated areas, urban areas is a result of human interaction at a macro scale, not individuals deciding to go out and kill during a quarantine. you don t see how increased human contact could lead to increased gang violence? how increased interactions at the office might lead to more workplace violence? how more clubs being open might lead to more jealous crimes of passion? it s just that you seem to be supporting a weak, partisan argument, is all.",2,250
9763,also add the next one harris record black crime,2,9
9766,"most of the police presence that has been lowered is due to retirements and resignations which are up 40 retirements and 18 resignations respectively. pressure has been building on them since everyone done makes a headline and is broadcasted pessimistically across the nation. while biden didn t do anything himself which i can recall a number of democrat mayors and governors have put some restrictions on police such as the current talks about abolishing foot pursuits in chicago. tell me how the difference in homicide type matters at this level. if it does matter that much then you can take the time to look through each case and see how the pandemic affected or hindered them in any way, once you get a significant amount that were delayed due to the pandemic then say something. crime overall is soaring and so is murder. a dangerous situation is spreading is some of these cities as murder become more common. if you want facts from me then give some yourself. neither of us has provided specific and unbiased sources. although the facts that murder is rising isn t being disputed on either side as well as the anti police sentiment that has arisen in the past year or so.",2,207
9771,wow the only thing you can get from a democratic is a bad excuse nothing more! how bout instead of playing the blame game you do something about it joe blow biden!!!!,2,32
9772,"so you think someone who has decided and resolved to kill someone won t because oh hey maybe i should stay home because of the pandemic huh, that doesn t really make sense. i don t know what they think and neither do you but most likely waiting isn t a part of their thought process. and when did this become urban vs rural. i m addressing the murder rates given rather than complaining about a subtle difference. with police presence falling and more restrictions falling on them legally and socially it is expected that more crime will go on, this isn t just biden, it is the thought that less police that is seemingly a good idea on the left that now is being attached to the right.",2,129
9785,the dude made fun of every single person out there who didn t agree with him and he s wondering why he lost? there s plenty of other candidates that are better than trump. that s just poison for the republican party.,5,42
9906,"i'm not believing this bullshit, who in their right mind would think a man can get pregnant????????",3,17
9914,i know it doesn't take much as biden is a typical democrat using feelings instead of facts.,3,17
9916,"i know, you would think yet democrats still support them. this is just sad that this is our current state of affairs.",2,22
9917,huh? why am i not surprised some guy proved that bafoon wrong,2,12
9920,sadly i have grown to expect this from the democrats.,2,10
9924,"yup! and once the vote is secured, shoot for college forgiveness for all lives , which would fundamentally widen the systemic gap that they just campaigned on, due to 65 of the open college loans being white americans. it especially widens the gap when you also consider that their messaging is also that minorities are also suffering during the hiring process due to their skin color. it fundamentally negates the entire concept of systemic oppression, and their constant ideology that education is the best antidote to systemic oppression. they're right, in that it is the best antidote, but their political action is self serving, and will fundamentally expand the 'systemic gap' that they just finished campaigning on.",3,117
9926,she shouldn't have said this. their entire campaign in 2020 was based on virtue signaling for black people.,3,18

10924,"gt;this is the line drawing i m talking about and is beside the point. and the line drawing is not an argument because you cannot redefine murder at will. it is also a pathetic argument that tries to make any differentiation between the fetus and a grown human which becomes pretty stupid. like one of the examples you provided for drawning the line, it's really weak '' heartbeat''. so if someone doesn't has a heartbeat then that person is death ? modern medicine begs to disagree, i believe defibrilators exist for no reason then ?and evne then you are disparaging the medical precents that make certain assumptions a medical diagnosis, like brain dead people for example. it's a weak argument, a terrible one at it, to ''debunk'', cuz it doesn't do it, the ''line drawing''. in abortion the only question that matters is if the fetus is human or not. any other discussion is subjective moralistic crap. gt;'my point has not changed, the really ? would you be so kind as to explain what does have brain activity your first post to me , have to do with the government not being able to force you to do stuff against your will ? your quote gt;if someone is on life support but are brain dead, is it murder to disconnect the life support? would you be so kind as well, as to tell me, what does someone intruding into your property, aka, your body, has to do with the government forcing you to do stuff against your will ? your quote gt;regardless of how those innocents got there, the decisions of others affects them and their saftey aswell. and bear in mind i did answer the possible argument against that and you decided to ignore it and change subject again. oh, i'm sorry, you ''didn't changed subject''. gt;enter a hospital and disconnect someone is murder, kidnap and kill someone is murder, what does either of these have to do with making decisions about your own body? sigh, well this is the ending of the above 90 iq conversation i guess, time to seek the puppets and color crayons. as it should be obvious and i already explained, let me quote myself but fear not i will try to make it ''easier to understand '' gt;if that's not the case, then it's not your body, it's someone else's. because it's not your own body. it's someone else's body. you see, if the fetus is a human being, then , it's not the mother's body anymore, it's someone else's body. you already tried to change the subject to another conversation, to the ''self defense'' argument, which is incredible stupid. you cannot force someone into a positon the fetus , then claim self defense while killing him. thus the point of the analogy with the kidnaping. the fetus didn't choose to be put in there, it was put in there by the conscious decision of other people. even if we were not to kidpan that person, and that person was thrown into your house by someone else, killing that person under the excuse of ''tresspassing '' it's not an option, because that person did not choose to be there himself. amp; x200b; i don't think i can make it more easy to understand but i have no hopes for you to picking up the argument, because you've ignored it before, and this clearly became a '' i must be right'' conversation for you. literally nothing new has come from you that i haven't heard before and you are scraping any argument possible to prove your point. it's sad, and intellectually dishonest, and as i showed, you clearly changed the point once you saw it was completely wrong.",2,624

11328,which means it has nothing to do with free speech it s the banning of subject material exactly like they can ban the teaching of pornography or the teaching of bomb making or the teaching of islam it s up to the school board and the budget and everything not taught is not going against free speech it s just not taught get over yourself,2,65
11331,"could you be anymore of a thick moron??? a schools curriculum is paid for with tax dollars it is not free speech get it thru your ignorant brain and learn something a state can decide what it s school budget can be spent on, and not spent on not teaching it moron, does not mean they are against your definition of free speech it just means tax dollars aren t going to be used teaching a specific class there did you get that through your moron brain?",2,87
11336,"this thread all your arguments are based upon your wrong definition of free speech and curriculum so who is the rational one? the person who actually understands the definition of both clearly you do not understand, so this conversation over",2,40
11337,saying it over doesn t make it true you are arguing free speech when it s curriculum funny you don t understand that but you understand free speech and company platforms,2,31

12405,"ah biden did not have to follow trumps deal, hell biden has undone everything trump has done with the exception of this.",2,22
12406,pathetic he can't take responsibility for his own actions.,3,9
12422,"i have never been a fan of the occupation and it's always been clear that a withdrawal would be a mess. but it was certainly possible for us to withdraw without the entire country collapsing before we were even done packing our bags. trump had a deal in place that would have allowed us to exit and transfer authority over to the ana in an orderly manner by may 1 while the taliban agreed to a halt in hostilities. biden renegged on that deal then he stupidly withdrew our troops from key facilities with zero transition pre planning, resulting in some of our biggest bases like bagram being looted before the ana could even assert control. that was completely avoidable and was probably one of the major catalysts for this whole disaster. so to answer your question yes, i do believe it would have made a difference having someone else in charge.",3,152
12423,"dems love defense spending too. its bipartisan more more more. leads me to believe we're only supposed to see division, but in reality they always agree on big defense, lousy healthcare and corrupt finance. round and round we go.",7,39
12426,"you are still not getting it i am not saying the pull out should have been stopped. it should have been an orderly handoff like trump planned, instead of literally marching our troops out the back door in the middle of the night like we did a month ago at bagram without even bothering to inform afghan officers that they were going to be taking over see",3,67
12427,i'll believe the gop is actually fiscally conservative the day they cut defense spending. until then it's just another government giveaway to create busywork jobs back in their home districts.,2,30
12430,"did you not read a word of what i just posted? i just acknowledged that there was nothing wrong with the decision to pull out the problem was how it was carried out, and biden managed to fuck it up.",3,40
12441,"for starters, not withdrawing our troops in the middle of the night with zero notice to afghan commanders this was supposed to be a coordinated hand off to the ana. instead we shagged off while our comrades were sleeping and they literally woke up to find their base abandoned by their comrades and looted by their own soldiers. pretty sure this had a powerful demoralizing effect on them and also was a huge confidence boost for the taliban that they could just walk up and take whatever they want without a fight . note that this happened barely a month ago, just before the taliban started going hog wild so i'm fairly certain this was a key catalyzing event that set off this disaster.",2,124
12442,pulling out wasn't the problem the problem is that trump set an agreement that ensured an orderly and peaceful transition and biden managed to completely fuck it up in barely half a year.,3,33
12444,we're barely half a year into biden's presidency and it's already one of the most disastrous in us history.,3,19
12445,carter must be delighted knowing that his administration will no longer be regarded as the most disastrous in us history.,5,20
12446,he inherited a deal that ensured an orderly and peaceful transistion and then promptly shat on it. then he made the decision about a month ago to withdraw troops from baghram afb and elsewhere with zero notice and didn't even bother to notify the afghan commanders. when the ana officers woke up they discovered the base had been abandoned by the us and looted by their own soldiers. this was shortly before the taliban started ramping up attacks and taking provincial cities so i strongly suspect this was a catalyzing event that both demoralized the ana and emboldened the taliban to believe they could take the whole country without hardly needing to put up a fight they were right . this idiotic admin literally pissed away 20 years of progress and thousands of american lives by trying to sneak out the back door. this outcome was not inevitable it is the product of hubris and sheer incompetence by the people currently in power in dc.,3,165

12822,"i wouldn't say that. crypto is volatile, with downside risk as much as upside risk. its a question of human psychology just as much as economics. the question of course comes down to macro economics. lets say the us dollar remains the world reserve currency and biden somehow manages to get inflation under control. then, crypto will go through another cycle where it crashes. as such, its a bad investment in the medium term. but let's say that the democrats retain control of the whitehouse in 2024, and inflation keeps rising. then we run into serious problems. i think the economy is in between a rock and a hard place. look at negative interest rates that are existing in europe. they have to take money out of the system. in theory, it could be done in the us with draconian wealth taxes, provided the dollars were burned instead of used to fund the government however all of these solutions just strengthen the crypto proposition of sound money. which is why hillary is afraid of it.",3,175

14679,you spelled stupidity wrong. let's not act like these are intelligent people,3,12
14891,"trump was a laughing stock as president. he's the one that demeaned and undermined nato, said it was obsolete, alienated our allies and sucked up to our enemies specifically putin . do you think he could have pulled our allies together the way biden is doing to respond to putin's invasion? he would be an utterly disaster in the present moment. don't forget he held ukrainian arms transfers hostage to pressure ukraine to cast dirt on biden. do you think he would lift a finger to help ukraine now?",3,89

14927,"so you believe biden, who is literally mentally retarded, is a strong president?",3,13
14929,putin doesn't invade ukraine if he wasn't reasonably certain they were going to join nato. let's say mexico wanted to join the warsaw pact back in the day. what do you suppose the reaction of the united states would have been? i'm guessing it would have been similar to russia's response ukraine. in fact i'm certain it would have been as evidenced by jfk's bay of pigs invasion of cuba and reagan's invasion of granada. i'm not arguing in favor of putin's war but there is another side to it. the war could have been avoided had biden not intentionally antagonized putin. one wonders if he didn't do so intentionally to deflect from his failing presidency.,4,116
14930,who cares what putin wants? ukraine is a sovereign nation. they have their own rights to self determination. that's what this is about a true battle for the free world.,4,30
14938,this isn't about putin not respecting biden. it's about the biden administration saber rattling by expressing a willingness to consider ukraine as a nato member. putin doesn't want nato any closer to russia and ultimately this is about biden's failed foreign policy.,6,42

15652,"i'm sorry are those taxes? paying for gas isn't a tax, the sales tax is, sure. if you're going to complain about tax increases actually complain about the increases in taxes. not just free market increases on goods that the president doesn't have direct control over",6,46
15663,"the problem is that biden wants to force it and is actively suppressing alternatives. it is proven that immunization from the virus is stronger, if you already had and survived it, than immunization from the vaccines. but it is a dangerous road, because you could very well die if you don t get the vaccine first. meanwhile, there are first signs of effective treatments for the infected. there are drugs which could help you recover and survive. but to suppress all alternatives to the vaccines is wrong and p es americans off. you may enforce mask and hygiene restrictions, but you may not pressure people into vaccination. they should have the right to choose want to do and not to do. pcr tests before flights are o.k. mask enforcement is also o.k. but you can t ban people from travel and social life for not being vaccinated. if they test negative, their rights shouldn t be infringed.",2,157
15664,your statement is once again false. the vaccine may lesson the effects of covid but you can still get it and also transmit it to others.,3,26

15666,"the vaccinated can still pass the virus on, especially the delta variant. vaccination does not keep you completely safe from infection. it just makes sure that it s harder for you to get infected and that when you do, you won t end up in the icu with a pretty good chance to die.",3,54
15673,biden would have to show some sort of leadership in the first place. biden and kamala came up with the afghan withdrawal plan and we saw how that went.,2,29
15674,fauchi has flip flopped on herd immunity at least 3 or 4 times. he lies as much about that as he does everything else. trusting fouchi with covid is about as smart as letting hunter hold your bag of crack for safe keeping.,3,43
15679,why are states with the heaviest restrictions still reporting record high numbers then? california is practically still in a state of lockdown.,3,22
15688,part of the reason his vaccine plan isn't working is because you post stuff like this.,2,16
15689,is it also biden's fault that you are posting something that is misleading? if his leadership were better would you not post this stuff? genuine questions. trying to figure out at what point it stops becoming biden's fault and at what point do you start taking a little responsibility.,3,49
15694,also have to consider how much more transmittable the delta variant is. that certainly accounts for some of this.,2,19
15695,it's worth considering how lock down measures impact this. a year ago there was not a lot going on due to lock down at least where i'm from and now everything is is completely open.,2,35

18654,by that same logic democrats think all republicans regardless of race are white supremacist neo nazis but to break that down for you the only so called terrorists are the blm rioters and only the rioters and more specifically only the ones that harmed others and destroyed property minus confederate statues tho i don't support destroying those as step one i would prefer to try to get them removed legally first and as for mexicans i would say the cartel members are terrorists as they force people to haul drugs or into the sex trade and just abuse the illegal immigrants hence why we should be harder on illegal immigration but make legal immigration easier and as for the others the worst i've seen or heard them called is sinners but i guess terrorists are technically sinners so you got me there but hey what do i know i'm a republican so i'm a bigot that hates any non white pro life christian regardless of my race or beliefs maybe just maybe and i know this sounds sarcastic and you'll probably say yea right ill never do that because their all idiots. but if you ever want to actually see what republicans are watch some of their news it doesn't have to be fox instead of taking a biased view on what republicans said or stand for etc you may learn that your not that different and what they say is cherry picked and leaves out context but i can honestly say this for both sides is that around 90 dems and reps are decent people that only want the best for the people of this beautiful melting pot of a country,2,282
