117,[],False,,ThrowACephalopod,,,[],,,,text,t2_42z04bkv,False,False,"&gt;Justice Clarence Thomas’s majority opinion in Egbert v. Boule, moreover, has implications that stretch far beyond the border. Egbert guts a seminal Supreme Court precedent, Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents (1971), which established that federal law enforcement officers who violate the Constitution may be individually sued — and potentially be required to compensate their victims for their illegal actions.

&gt;Egbert is a severe blow to the broader project of police accountability. While it does not target lawsuits against state law enforcement officers who violate the Constitution, it all but eliminates the public’s ability to sue Border Patrol officers — and possibly all federal officers — who commit similar violations.

&gt;In fairness, Egbert does indicate that people who believe their rights were violated by federal law enforcement may file a grievance with the law enforcement agency that employs the officer who allegedly violated the Constitution. But such grievances will be investigated by other law enforcement officers, and no court or other agency can review a law enforcement officer’s decision to exonerate a fellow officer.

Essentially, this decision says that federal law enforcement officials can no longer be privately sued if they violate the constitution. Instead, the victimized party must file a grievance with the agency they believe violated their rights which will be internally investigated by that agency.

It is ludicrous. It essentially gives police free reign to do whatever they please, regardless of how unconstitutional it is.",856aeb8b4fe5e4673f8097f807000735486bafe6,True,False,,,,,0,1654747160,,0,{},ibozxyd,False,t3_v84yvy,False,True,t3_v84yvy,/r/democrats/comments/v84yvy/supreme_court_gives_federal_law_enforcement/ibozxyd/,1654747172,1,True,True,False,democrats,t5_2qn70,r/democrats,public,,0,[],

216,[],False,,codamission,,,[],,,,text,t2_14jod6,False,False,"My views are unpopular in the party:

I believe that, categorically, conservatism is damaging both to democracy and to the prosperity of Americans, and that a downward trend of the popularity of the ideology would solve a host of America's issues, acting as the rootball from many others branch out. It is not some ideology of ""evolution over revolution"" or whatever drivel Republican leadership attempts to forcefeed the public. There is no ""measured and cautious change"" within conservatism, rather it is the belief in hierarchy and the monopolization of power, and it, by the nature of conservatism itself, inevitably leads to bigotry and classism.

Conservatism begins with Edmund Burke who is commonly referred to as its Father, a man who openly believed that an ordained aristocratic nobility is right, and that egalitarianism was profane. This is anathema to the very principles of John Locke and Thomas Paine, the ideological forefathers liberalism and the American philosophy of government.

Liberal economic theory centers on the forefather of capitalism, Adam Smith. Economists of his age were concerned with the philosophical question of ""what is value and how is it determined?"" Adam Smith laid out the Labor Theory, which essentially said that the value of a product is a formula of materials+effort=agreed price. An object's value comes from the combination of the raw materials and the hours/skill of the labor that went into making the refined product (sidenote: Marx would later pick this up and run with it, but he didn't invent the Labor Theory, and his works are meant to build off Smith as a sort of ""next step in economic evolution"").

Edmund Burke, on the other hand, argued that Price and Value were the same. An object was only as valuable as whatever price a person of means was willing to pay for it. Nobody ever got cheated, nobody ever got a good deal, what they paid was its value. But what this also meant was that *value rested solely in the hands of those with money, and therefore those with more money had the right to more power in deciding the value of people and their products*. He additionally argued that while Locke and Rousseau were correct that the nobility had failed France, and that the revolution was inevitable if not justified, they differed in that Locke, the founder of modern Liberalism, argued for an egalitarian society where there was no such thing as an elite. To him, neither by merit nor birthright should anyone have more power or legal rights than another. Burke was very different. He thought the problem wasn't with nobility itself, but that France had an incompetent nobility. Burke suggested the nobility not be hereditary, but by merit, determined out of competition. He initially suggested this to be through war, but he thought capitalism and the volatile market would be sufficient in creating a nobility of the rich.

Burke's ideas may (or at least should) disgust you, because they are contrary to democratic government, but they are the foundation upon which conservatism, one of the serious problems damaging the country, if not *the main problem*. Burke's ideas on the market were popularized during the Marginal Revolution, the idea that the utility of a product for the consumer was the primary determinant of value, something that got wrapped into conservative ideology and then, probably to Adam Smith's disgust, associated with Capitalism. It bestows power onto those with money, but not on the market (these theories are also very useful for people looking to counter Marxism).

While Nietzsche was not a conservative, his works were influential on the Marginalists, and is still widely quoted by libertarians, conservatives and even Nazis:

&gt;Only the most intellectual of men have any right to beury to the tburautyiful. Only in them can goodness escape being weakness.

James fitsjames stepehen, who wrote a rebuttal against progressive liberalism belived:

&gt;To obey a real superior, to submit to a real necessity and make the best of it in good part is one of the most important of all virtues. A virtue absolytely essential to the attainment of anything great and lasting

Hayek believed:

&gt;The freedom that will be used by only one man in a million may be more imporotant to society and more benficial to the majority than any freedom that we all use.

Ayn Rand may have derided conservatives, but her views were so fundamental to libertarianism and neoconservative economic policy that they have to be mentioned:

&gt; The man at the top of the intellectual pyramid contributes the most to all those below him, but gets nothing except his material payment. The man at the bottom, who, left to himself, would starve in his hopeless ineptitude, contributes nothing to those above him but recieves the bonues of all their brains.

The Godfather of Neoconservatism, Irving Crystal, felt the hierarchy should extend beyond the border into international politics:

&gt; What's the point of being the greatest, most powerful nation in the world and not having an imperial role?

And modern conservatives love the natural hierarchies of Jordan Peterson, who argues that humans, like crustaceans, are biologically predisposed to *find joy* in a stable place in the hierarchy, and that those struggling with a middling place within it are fighting their very nature (something anthropologists and other psychologists take issue with).

My party keeps behaving as though conservativism's disdain for equity isn't a central theme of the ideology, and instead is anew and vestigial wing of the Republican Party. Conservatism upholds the staus quo and defends the powerful. From democracy, from Communism, and from social justice. At every attempt by the disadvantaged to gain more power, or indeed any power at all, they are met by opposition by conservatives. Women's suffrage, slavery, democracy itself, any at all movements by a lower class of citizen. Conservatism was founded on the principles that humans are innately unequal and that society flourishes when power is concentrated among the deserving few. And given the respect for the founders of these ideals, the length to which they quoted and the frequency with which they are honored, it does not appear that conservatism will shed even the likes of Burke, let alone his derivative successors. 

Conservatives claim to be a party of measured progress, but do nothing to advance social or economic progress, instead advocating programs that, when successfully implemented, have concentrated power or money in the hands of an increasingly smaller group. And when they gain enough power and popularity, they drop this pretense of measured progress. ""We are the party of evolution not revolution"", they say ""we believe in slow and steady advances"" they assure everyone, usually just before saying ""but now is the time for swift, decisive action"". Most every conservative Republican leader will claim to be a break with tradition, flipping the script, bending the rules, outspending democrats, invading privacy and starting a war with zero exit strategy....and repeated every 8 years for 50 years.

They will claim to be this stodgy old man of a party, stuck in their elderly ways, but this is just a facade used to describe how ""revolutionary they're going to be when they rally their reactionary base, the *real*, *active*, *influential* side of the party.

Most democracies may have a left side and a right side, but the right side doesn't have to be even be conservative, and in many developed nations it is more accurate to describe it as a market liberal side with soft social liberalism, the conservatives are often relegated to a fringe party of traditionalists. There is nothing that says we must have conservatism, or even rightism as our right side of politics, there is only my Democratic colleagues claiming that such an idea is in bad form.",aa955db30cd4f4df5b5c6e545352f1587356678c,True,False,,,,,0,1654769085,,0,{},ibpr1fx,False,t3_uqcjic,False,True,t3_uqcjic,/r/democrats/comments/uqcjic/hello_i_would_like_to_ask_for_democrats_opinions/ibpr1fx/,1654769098,1,True,True,False,democrats,t5_2qn70,r/democrats,public,,0,[],

I can walk up to a taco truck, into a local taqueria, or go to a Taco Bell and buy a taco by handing over a dollar and change in cash, with no background check, no permanent record of the transaction, and it can be done in a minute.

If I want to buy an AR-15 from a dealer, I have to go to the dealer, present identification, fill out am ATF Form 4473 (a PDF copy of it, so you can see what the form is, is here: [https://www.atf.gov/file/61446/download](https://www.atf.gov/file/61446/download)), and that record of sale must be kept for at *least* 20 years (and if the dealer closes before 20 years, they have to turn over the records to the ATF, which keeps the records permanently).  These requirements come from the Gun Control Act of 1968.

Then, I have to have an NICS background check (as mandated by the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993) which checks Federal databases to ensure I'm legally eligible to own a firearm, meaning I haven't had any of the following:

1. A felony conviction.
2. A dishonorable discharge from the military.
3. A conviction for domestic violence, even if misdemeanor.
4. Been found not competent to stand trial.
5. Been found not guilty on grounds of insanity.
6. Been involuntarily committed to a mental hospital (not just for a 72 hour ""Baker Act"" evaluation, actual long term commitment after evaluation).
7. Been placed under guardianship/receivership.

. . .then, after I have passed the background check, THEN I can buy the weapon.

Tacos aren't that regulated.

301,[],False,,TillThen96,,,[],,,,text,t2_3qxeqlwj,False,True,"The military is exempted from this bill, as ""qualified individuals.""  But there's a problem with that language.

I would go farther, and say that any ""qualified individual"" includes any individual who left the service in an honorable fashion, has damned well earned the right to possess these weapons at home, subject to ongoing safe storage and handling, and, a ""clean"" record with definitions **TBD** by minds more informed than mine - like a militia ""conference.""

Like you say, you're trained, have served, and your first duties in possession of the weapons are to honor and freedom and protection.  Damned lucky to have you.

You've *earned* the right of the 2A, sir, and you ARE the very definition of ""well-regulated militia.""

Rhetorical:  Would you want to fight alongside a untrained, undisciplined punk kid who never served, thinks ""rules of engagement"" is fun video game, and the only chain of command he understands (much less follows) is ordering from DoorDash?  He just wants to join the shooting fun, become famous.  What if he's in the treeline opposite you, no chain of command, texting his game buddy about what to do about the rustle of the leaves he just saw, just across the clearing?

How about that idiot fat-cat lawyer who aimed his machine gun at BLM protestors for using his private estate street?  Would you go to war with that couple?  Want them in the treeline opposite you?

Because I'm assuming that the only time you would pull out your weapons of war is if you and the rest of your qualified, well-regulated militia felt a valid, authentic need.  (other than drill and practice)

Not only do I see these things, but I also see little value in untrained, undisciplined people having access to weapons of war.  I'd send them to your militia, if your unit so chose to train and regulate them.  AND NO, they couldn't take their weapons home until they understood ALL of the rules - rules about weapons, ammo, chain of command, rules of engagement and whatever else your State team deems necessary.  Maybe they'd never get to take them home.  Your militia could demand they put in four years of training to become ""qualified.""  Difference is, they get to go home to mom or SO every night.

I'll pose one more rhetorical: Do you want to be a minuteman out there in the bush/woods, trying to dodge the unfriendly fire of how ever many *millions of punks and lawyers* have these guns?  It would be like *The Purge*.  How about Lauren Boebert - would you take her to war with you? 

She has her fucking kids posing with weapons - soldier material?  She doesn't know enough not to do that.  They can fucking be kids, have kid lives, then join the military if they like.  Nothing wrong with hunting, that sort of thing for kids, but to thrust them out front like that with machine guns for political gain?  What trash she is.  *and there's plenty of other evidence on that opinion*

I can't even dwell for a second on what one like you would go through if a civie becomes the victim of friendly fire, be they kid, punk, lawyer, whatever.  A fourteen year-old who's shot dad's weapon out back, and is eager to help.  You're forced to shoot, because they're shooting at *you* in total ignorance.

I'm trying to say those legislators/civilians who think that the only qualifications to own these weapons are a clean record and being 18 **are not on your side** of things, but are money-grubbing, lying traitors who would put people like you (and the rest of us you guard) at high risk of injury/death.

They aren't qualified, and no ""shooting range"" can qualify them.  They may be able to load the weapon and pull a trigger, but I'm betting that's the extent of their skill levels.

This is the lie the NRA and GOP has shoved down the collective American throat for decades.  There IS a precedent clause to the 2A, and it's not to be ignored or overlooked as if it doesn't exist.

The link to the Bill is below.  I'm sure you can find other alterations it needs, but I'm also betting that you're not entirely opposed to it, either.

It's my assumption that if you found a nut among your ranks, someone frothing at the mouth for little more than a high body count, you would develop methods to deal them, legally speaking.

Who do I trust to weigh in?  Not politicians, not the NRA, not civilians with no concept of the care you would exercise, but people like YOU.  People well-qualified to manage their well-regulated militia, just like the 2A reads in its entirety.  Your oath remains to the Constitution, not the government.  Were I you, I would start demanding the respect *you have earned.*  You're no untrained, undisciplined ordinary civilian.  There's a huge difference between these two types of people.

Summary is Tab 1, Full text is Tab 2. The summaries are rarely enough description to see the sneaky stuff in the text.

I am not military, and my related military folk are long passed away.

If I may, my dad would have said to you...  *GET YOUR ASS IN GEAR!*  in this case, meaning, fight for what is yours.  Civilians have not earned that which you have.

And my last thought on it, is that if you have kids, I'd bank you have damn well taught them about weapon safety.  How can a Lauren Boebert do this like you can?  She uses the kids and weapons as political props, and she's raked in $millions.  What does she think of you and those like you?  Not much, not from someone who would treat and use her own kids like that.  You and those like you need to start telling people like her to STFD and STFU, and tell those who want to pass this legislation *exactly* what you need it state, then push those who oppose it TF out.

We wouldn't need to harden schools like prisons, to keep the prisoners *out*.  That is pure lunacy.

So here's the deal, you're taking this from a straight hard-right position. The **current** interpretation is that it provides individual right to bear arms with no regulation. This interpretation is not situated in Supreme Court precedent. The last SCOTUS decision indicated that individual rights exist, but the state has a right to regulate (written by Scalia if I recall).

But that's still a modern interpretation. For people that claim to be originalists, there's no contextualizing of the situation in which the second amendment was written. 

But even with all of that, I want to point something out. The second amendment was an amendment. It was not part of the original constitution. In addition, talking about repealing the second amendment would then make your argument that ""it would be against the second amendment and my constitutionally protected civil right"". It would no longer be a constitutionally protected civil right.

See, the government isn't defined by someone else and we just live in the rules they define. We get to define it. It is only part of the constitution because it is part of the constitution. So using the constitution as a bludgeon to demand that we never change something is ridiculous at its core.

Instead, talk to me about why? Why is this a protected civil right, is this something we want for our country. What does it provide us, and does it cost for that.

If you walk into a gun store or the gun counter at a sporting good store, they're ABSOLUTELY supposed to rigidly follow all of those rules, or big Federal problems happen.

Those rules don't apply to private person-to-person sales or gifts.

If it's just a random private person selling their personally owned guns, then they don't have to.  If I wanted to sell off all my guns, I could rent a table at a gun show, put the guns on the table, and sell them for cash, no questions asked, to anyone who walked up.  It's the same as if I wanted to sell a gun to a co-worker or give a gun as a gift to a family member.

That's the so-called ""Gun Show Loophole"".  It's how Grampa can give his grandson a rifle for his birthday so he can teach him to shoot and hunt, or how someone could give their spouse a pistol as a gift, without forcing them to go to a gun dealer to conclude the transaction.

However, if someone is regularly going to gun shows and buying and selling guns with the intent to generate a profit, they're supposed to be a licensed dealer and failure to do so is a serious Federal felony and can get you thrown in Federal prison for years. . .if the ATF catches you.  

That's the *real* problem with Gun Shows, is that there are people at those shows who are regularly buying and selling guns, trying to make a profit in the gun trade, who aren't properly registered as Federal dealers because they tell the gun shows they are just private citizens and not a business.

. . .for no good reason other than to placate the neo-prohibitionists at MADD, we raised the drinking age to 21 and all that did was make people under 21 get their over-21 friends to buy their alcohol for them.  Everything I saw about alcohol consumption while an undergraduate emphasized just how pointless and silly the drinking age of 21 is, because all it does is drive drinking underground.  I had a roommate who nearly died of alcohol poisoning when he was 18 and was binge drinking one of the first moments he could get access to alcohol, and everyone around when it was happening was afraid to take him to the hospital for fear of legal repercussions for him and for them, as his buddies had also all been drinking, and that experience that cemented my view that the drinking age of 21 does more harm than good.

No, they aren't.

*People* are dangerous.  Guns are only dangerous when used by people in a negligent or hostile fashion.  Guns don't magically make people drop dead just while sitting around.

Two professors studied every mass shooting since 1966, and every school and workplace shooting regardless of size since 1999, and was able to find a remarkable amount of similarity in most of the shooters. (https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/05/27/stopping-mass-shooters-q-a-00035762)

They put together a profile (both biographical and psychological) that covers the vast majority of mass shooters.

People have had access to guns, including rifles with high capacity, for a very long time (a century or more for modern firearms) and mass shootings as we know them have only really been around as anything more than very rare events for less than a quarter century.

It really is a mental health crisis, and we need to do something to deal with that.  

It's an epidemic of people with a history of major trauma beginning in early childhood, who feel ostracized, self-loathing, rejected by peers, often with a history of prior suicide attempts, often having made prior attempts to get help but those attempts were ignored by whoever they reached out to. . .who get pushed into a state of committing suicide in a very extravagant fashion (paraphrasing from the article in question about the profile)

For every mass shooter out there, you've got hundreds of thousands or a million or more perfectly non-violent, non-criminal, peaceful citizens owning those same guns. . .so it's not the guns, it's people, and no amount of ""Guns bad!"" propaganda will change that.

Look at evidence, look at research, look for the root cause.  Guns were just as easily available in the 1970's or 1980's and mass shootings were extremely rare back then.  It's social and cultural changes that are fueling that specific profile, and helping people in crisis before they reach that breaking point is what will end this, not demonizing guns.",8ecc713801e3e843928581e5f4fe439e68b95d5d,True,False,,,,,0,1654803186,,0,{},ibro9ca,False,t3_v7ym6d,False,True,t1_ibrmkzo,/r/democrats/comments/v7ym6d/its_the_damn_guns/ibro9ca/,1654803197,1,True,True,False,democrats,t5_2qn70,r/democrats,public,,0,[],

. . .I can't flipping believe that I can literally point to a profile of mass shooters that has been diligently researched, that fits the large majority of mass shooters over the last 50 years, and it's being so casually dismissed.

We keep asking ourselves WHY this happens, we can now start to get an answer. . .and instead of addressing a root cause, the talk is still all ""guns guns guns"" like that's going to stop anything, when the behavioral profile makes it clear that even with lower-capacity weapons that would need reload more often, people would STILL be doing this.

I can tell you up front that based on the profile developed, magazine sizes won't make ANY impact on shootings, because they do literally nothing to someone who has already decided on an elaborate gun based suicide that has a revenge/rage element to it.  These are people with profound anger rejection, lashing out in a way that they know and plan for to kill themselves, and take down as many other people that they see as tied to the source of their trauma as possible on the way down.

It doesn't matter if it's a 30 round magazine, 15 round magazine, or 10 round magazine for that, all that means is more frequent reloads.  Someone could be doing that with a six-shooter revolver and speed loaders.

There's no point in touching magazine sizes, because it neither touches the root cause, or in any way would dissuade someone affected by the root cause from that course of action.",52f41691ac6b2543cfd1b8d24fe816bd946d6b9f,True,False,,,,,0,1654813595,,0,{},ibsbvut,False,t3_v7ym6d,False,True,t1_ibs7rgc,/r/democrats/comments/v7ym6d/its_the_damn_guns/ibsbvut/,1654813612,1,True,True,False,democrats,t5_2qn70,r/democrats,public,,0,[],

Politicians and the gun industry listen to *you* and act on those conversations.  Healthcare is not parceled out like it's a lottery.

Is there any impediment to forming militias, sans governmental ""permission?""  I don't think so, but were it me, I would gather a group of willing vets, make an appointment with the local FBI, and make it clear that you're no ""domestic terrorist"" group, but intend to uphold the laws and statutes of your State and nation.  That you intend to be a ""well-regulated"" vet militia group standing on the ready to intervene if called upon (I don't know how to state that... maybe it's lawyer time.)

H.R.350 - Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act of 2022 was passed by the House, but the Senate did not have the votes to consider it.  *It created no new laws*, but only authority and funding for more personnel and designated positions to address the threat.  The other thing it is, is a broadcast that the Feds need help.  As it applies to all States, that broadcast may be an ""in"" to liaise with the Feds, to liaise with the State, to fill needed positions and duties.  There are millions of vets of all ages and skills, and there's no reason to assume that any militia have only gun-carrying members.  Admin, computer, comms, all sorts of positions and tools are needed to run a militia.  I see it as a win for both State security and vets who need jobs, jobs for which they are already trained and well-qualified. ;)  And, you would know an illegal order when you see one, unlike civilians.

It's just a thought.  I so want to support our vets, because without you, we're ...lost.  You, militias, are the missing element, and it's high time we brought it to everyone's attention.  All we have to do is look around.  All we have to do is honor the 2A.

And here's what I consider to be the proof for the need of militias.  They would be a bi-directional protection:
