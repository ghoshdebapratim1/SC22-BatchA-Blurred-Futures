22,"Obviously? Mark Meadows doesn't believe the law applies to him.

If he knew he was going to register in this state? Why did he wait so long to purchase or rent property?

&gt;On September 19th, about three weeks before North Carolina’s voter-registration deadline for the general election, Meadows filed his paperwork. On a line that asked for his residential address - “where you physically live,” the form instructs - Meadows wrote down the address of a fourteen-by-sixty-two-foot mobile home in Scaly Mountain. He listed his move-in date for this address as the following day, September 20th.

The owner of the property mentioned that the Meadows did rent the property from her for a few months in 2020. However? It didn't make it clear about how often Meadows himself came up.

&gt;As for Mark Meadows, she said, “He did not come. He’s never spent a night in there.”

The new owner says:

&gt;“I’ve made a lot of improvements,” Abele said, “But when I got it, it was not the kind of place you’d think the chief of staff of the President would be staying.” I asked him what he made of Meadows listing the property as his place of residence on his voter-registration form. “That’s weird that he would do that,” he said. “Really weird.”

&gt;After Trump lost the election, Meadows was one of the most influential Republicans claiming without factual evidence that widespread voter fraud had taken place. (He reiterated those claims in a recent memoir.) In late 2020 and early 2021, he e-mailed the Justice Department, urging it to investigate claims of voter fraud, including claims that courts had previously rejected.

Yes. He committed a crime. Knowingly.

&gt;Did Meadows potentially commit voter fraud by listing the Scaly Mountain address on his registration form? It’s a federal crime to provide false information to register to vote in a federal election. Under President Trump, the White House Web site posted a document, produced by the conservative Heritage Foundation, intended to present a “sampling” of the “long and unfortunate history of election fraud” in the U.S. Many of the cases sampled involve people who registered to vote at false addresses, including, for instance, second homes that did not serve as a person’s primary residence.

OK. It's pretty clear to me.

&gt;Former President Donald Trump spoke glowingly about North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un at an RNC retreat in New Orleans, Louisiana, according to a recording obtained by The Washington Post reporter Josh Dawsey.

It's because it's what __he really wants.__

&gt;Dawsey, in a tweet, said Trump told donors that Kim's advisers were ""sitting at attention"" when he talked and ""cowered"" when he spoke to them. Trump added that one general ""stood up so fast,"" per Dawsey's tweet. I want my people to act like that ...

He __is NOT joking.__

&gt;The former president also referred to Kim as ""seriously tough"" and ""absolutely the leader of that country,"" per the tweet.

Don't forget? He said they exchanged love letters. Love letters that he took with him to Mara Largo and then had to return recently.

&gt;He also pushed back on Vice President Mike Pence's implication that he is an ""apologist"" for Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Excuse me? We have the proof.

Biden literally called Putin out at every step, forged alliances and worked with nations to  bring down economic sanctions against Putin to the point where he may soon be replaced.

167,"The Affordable Care Act (ACA) or Obamacare, has many guarantees that people really seem to have forgotten.

Before the ACA, there __were no dependable guarantees__ when it came to your healthcare plan. Now?

&gt;A requirement that health plans must permit you to enroll regardless of health status, age, gender, or other factors that might predict the use of health services. Except in some states, guaranteed issue doesn't limit how much you can be charged if you enroll.

Now? More than ever before? Americans really have an opportunity to get health care coverage.

Coverage that they could really use.

&gt;Low-income Americans who missed signing up for 2022 Affordable Care Act coverage can now enroll in plans with $0 premiums through the federal exchange's website.

Due to the pandemic? The ACA is offering health care choices for many people who lacked heath care opportunities. Including? Additional help with premium costs and increasing household income levels for easier approval.

&gt;The expanded enrollment opportunity stems from the Democrats' $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package, which was enacted last year. In addition to temporarily providing more generous subsidies that reduce premiums to $0 or close to it for low-income folks, the law allows them to sign up outside of the traditional open enrollment season, which ended in mid-January.

There is no guarantee that Congress will provide an extension for the health care premium assistance allotment.

&gt;The special enrollment period could run beyond 2022 if Congress extends the enhanced premium assistance, which expires after this year.

The __ACA has three goals:__

&gt;■ Make affordable health insurance available to more people. The law provides consumers with subsidies (“premium tax credits”) that lower costs for households with incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level (FPL).

&gt;• If your income is above 400% FPL, you may still qualify for the premium tax credit in 2022.

&gt;• If your income is at or below 150% FPL, you may qualify to enroll in or change Marketplace coverage through a Special Enrollment Period.

They make up rules out of thin air. That __don't really even exist.__

And then he __pretends like they are a law.__

Like when he would not approve Merrick Garland when President Obama submitted him as a __nominee for a SCOTUS position.__ He would not allow a hearing. Even though the election was nine months away.

&gt;*When Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died in February 2016, Senate Republicans came out of the gate insisting that his seat not be filled due to the presidential election about nine months away. The Democrats vehemently disagreed. But ultimately, President Barack Obama's last Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland — a judge who mainly agreed with now Chief Justice John Roberts, a conservative, when they served together on the appeals court — never received a hearing.

He used an excuse that has never even been heard of before. Never. He just made it up.

He didn't say that __he was unqualified.__ He just said that the new president should be able to pick the justice. This reasoning has never ever been used before.

&gt;*With the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Sept. 18, the debate over Supreme Court nominations during an election year is renewed. At least one Republican — Sen. Lindsey Graham — had said a Supreme Court vacancy should not be filled until after the 2020 election. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, however, is saying the opposite of what he did in 2016.*

Shameful.

Merrick Garland was a prosecutor on the Timothy McVeigh Oklahoma City bombing and Ted Kaczynski Unabomber cases. When you couple that with his experience as a federal judge, he is easily one of the most qualified people to be attorney general and run investigation like this

https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/merrick-garland-oklahoma-city-bombing/2021/02/19/a9e6adde-67f2-11eb-8468-21bc48f07fe5_story.html

Meanwhile, the fact that you're not privy to the knowledge of the investigation is exactly as it should be. It is standard prosecutorial practice not to publicize conspiracy investigations. 

For good reason. Because members of such a conspiracy would more proactively obstruct the investigation.

According to the US Constitution, __Congress is in charge__ of determining the number of SCOTUS justices.


&gt;*The Constitution places the power to determine the number of Justices in the hands of Congress. The first Judiciary Act, passed in 1789, set the number of Justices at six, one Chief Justice and five Associates. Over the years Congress has passed various acts to change this number, fluctuating from a low of five to a high of ten. The Judiciary Act of 1869 fixed the number of Justices at nine and no subsequent change to the number of Justices has occurred.*

The SCOTUS has ranged from five to ten members over the years.


I would not mind if there were an __even number of justices on the court,__ instead of the *nine we have.*

As long as it was an even number, I don't care about the number.

391,"LONG POST: There’s a lot of misinformation and confusion about what the end of Disney’s Reedy Creek district means for the company and for taxpayers. 

Here’s what I know, after talking to lobbyists, lawyers and tax officials:

For those of you who haven’t heard, Reedy Creek is the special tax district of Walt Disney World. It’s essentially its own city. Disney pays taxes to Reedy Creek, which operates a fire department, planning department, sewer treatment plant and public works department. Disney controls Reedy Creek, which means if they want to build a new hotel or highway, they just have to ask themselves for permission.

The biggest loss for Disney is the end of that control. It’s a lot easier to ask yourself for permission than to go to the county. While they already follow all laws and building codes and they’ll still get everything they want, it’s going to slow the process down. Potholes might develop on roads that they no longer pave themselves. They can’t just call a meeting or alter their comprehensive plan on a random Friday. They also can’t quickly finance new public projects like a fire station.

The bigger issue for everyone else is the tax revenue. Disney already pays the same local property taxes as every other landowner. Reedy Creek added its own tax on top of that to pay for its projects. That tax – $163 million per year – is illegal outside of the district. When Reedy Creek goes away, that tax goes away, and Orange and Osceola Counties can’t do anything to get it back.

However, the counties will now be responsible for all of the services Reedy Creek provides and all of the debt it has accumulated. They can’t raise sales taxes or impact fees. So, the counties will have to raise property taxes to make up the difference. They must tax every property equally – not just Disney – and therefore it’s expected that property taxes in Orange County will rise as much as 25% next June. Osceola, much smaller and less wealthy, is still working on its figures.

Lawyers largely agree that the state followed all the laws while doing this. They agree Disney may sue, but probably doesn’t have much ground to stand on. Some believe a vote of residents or delegates from the district is required to make this legal. That doesn’t appear to be the case here because a vote was never held to implement the district 55 years ago.

Essentially, Disney will lose some control of its property, and get a $163 million per year tax break and ~$1 billion of debt passed onto taxpayers. Some things will be negotiated – Disney still controls Bay Lake and Lake Buena Vista, two actual towns within RCID. Lawmakers might backtrack from this plan during the next session now that they’re realizing what they’ve done. However, aside from maybe taking away the company’s ability to build a nuclear plant, we have yet to hear how this benefits Florida and especially the local residents in any way. 

The residents, by the way, had no say in this vote, no say in their property taxes going through the roof, and no desire to have their communities staring at financial ruin thanks to 72 hours of orchestrated revenge.

392,Don’t get me wrong. They should pay workers more and have higher tax rates. However the issue is that they are doing this as targeted retaliation to Disney’s stance (albeit an overall soft one) on LGBTQIA+ rights. They aren’t doing it for tax or economic disparity reasons. A deal they brokered is being yanked because they vocally disagrees with government. Kinda chilling.,1

Please use __reputable sources__ when making such an inflammatory statement. And? At __least more than one.__

Billions of Pfizer shots have been given. Repeat that. Billions.

&gt;*Misleading claims suggesting that more than 1,200 died after suffering adverse reactions to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine have once again been spread on social media.*

So many people died due to the incompetence of one term twice impeached former President Trump. People that did not need to die.

&gt;*The phrase ""Pfizer documents"" became a top trending topic on Twitter, thanks in part to a tweet posted by Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who previously had her personal Twitter account permanently suspended for ""repeated violations"" of the social media site's COVID-19 misinformation policy.
In her tweet, Greene shared a screenshot of a document released by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) which she took as meaning that 1,223 people died during ""Pfizer's post authorization adverse events"" report. A number of other conservative figures also posted why they are skeptical about the safety of the vaccine with the #pfizerdocuments hashtag.*

As always MTG is spreading alternative facts.

And? Don't forget that one term twice impeached former President Trump and his wife have received their shots.

My husband and I have taken four Pfizer shots each.

My neighbors, friends, family members, and acquaintances I meet in the elevator? We  have all had Pfizer shots.

Not one of us has had a reaction. I think my arm hurt a little bit (my arm often hurts after other shots), but other than that I am fine. We are all fine. We stayed out of the hospital and stayed out of the ICU.

I also have people in my building and some of my friends / family members that died because they refused to get the shots. Any shot. And then begged for the shot when they found out that the pandemic was real, and not something that was made up. But by then? They were told it was too late for them to have the shot.

That's their choice.

&gt;*The report states that of the billions of vaccines shipped worldwide between December 1, 2020, and February 28, 2021, there were 42,086 reported reactions.
These included those who had fully recovered or are recovering from COVID, those who recovered but were still experiencing some symptoms, those not recovered at the time of the report, and the 1,223 who are listed as ""fatal.The 1,223 fatalities listed in the report are among 158,893 adverse effects reports from health officials from across the world. The cause of each fatality is not verified and therefore may also include those who had ""various illnesses"" such as cancer or cardiovascular disease, Pfizer spokeswoman Dervila Keane told AFP.*

The amount of lives that all of the vaccinations have saved is a miracle. 

__Everyone recognizes that.__

If you researched all of the drug trials / investigatory periods of new drugs / possible solutions / cures?

Every type of medication that has ever come out since they started tracking these issues? You will find that some people died during the trials. That is a normal process of discovery and learning things about a new disease. Or even an old disease for which they are trying to find answers.

■ Sometimes people were allergic to the ingredients that were in the shot. You don't really know you're allergic to something until you are exposed to it. It happens.

■ Some people died because of some other disease they had.

■ Some people had adverse reactions.

You never really know unless you discover the statistics of each trial.

Stop your fear-mongering and start focusing on reality.

Vaccinations and masks save lives.

&gt;*While the report discussed adverse reactions to the vaccine in a 90-day period and the figures are genuine, the pharmaceutical company has said the documents do not link the vaccine as being responsible for the people's death.*

It's important to stick with the facts. Read an entire report before jumping to conclusions.

&gt;*They are part of a pattern of inaccurate claims -- which AFP Fact Check has repeatedly debunked -- that seek to raise fears about Covid-19 shots via reports of deaths and other adverse effects following vaccination, even though no causal link was established between the problems and the jabs. The document cited in the articles contains nothing to indicate the vaccine was linked to deaths. The figure of 1,223 fatalities among 158,893 adverse effects reflect ""spontaneous"" reports from sources that include health officials in several countries, without any verification of the cause, among the millions of vaccinated people worldwide during that period, Pfizer spokeswoman Dervila Keane told AFP. It does not indicate specific causes of death, and the fatalities may include people with ""various illnesses"" such as cancer or cardiovascular disease, she said.*

In fact, kids that are smarter are less likely to believe what the adults are telling them (school staff are required to say there are more than two genders where I live) and are more likely to use biology to debunk the recently discovered “differences” between gender and sex.

Of course we have rights that aren't expressly enumerated. But does that mean that I have a right to build a nuclear power plant in my back yard? Of course not. The government of course has authority to regulate people's actions. 

I'm not sure that I would call Laurence Tribe a conservative, and he has also argued against an expansive 9A interpretation.

570,"&gt;Nothing in the Constitution grants the SCOTUS judicial review, but nothing in the Constitution explicitly grants people the right to privacy or the right to an abortion either. **We choose to accept implied powers and implied rights because no constitution can ever truly encompass everything that can ever be needed.**

Technically, Judicial Review isn't even implied by the Constitution which is why it had to be granted by the Court to itself. When I say ""its not found in the Constitution"" I mean both explicitly and tacitly. But the reason I brought it up was to explain to you that an independent judiciary is impossible. 

Now, in terms of implied rights, specifically, the right to privacy, that does have Constitutional basis in the Ninth Amendment along with Fourth Amendment.  


&gt;The problem with the expansive rights argument is that I'm not sure that the Founders really did mean for it to be implied so much as amended. What correspondence do you think proves this case?

Well, first, the inclusion of the Ninth Amendment makes the intent explicit as I stated in my previous post. The Federalists opposed the inclusion of the Bill of Rights in the Constitution on the basis that such a list would imply that the list of enumerated rights was to be considered exhaustive and no other rights would be protected. Which, ironically, is the argument you are making when you oppose the ""expansive rights argument"" along with most conservatives, whether they are textualists or originalists.

The idea that the only rights that exist were enshrined in the Bill of Rights no founder agreed with, including Anti-Federalists. The question then came down to how to protect unenumerated rights. The negotiated solution was the Ninth Amendment.

Here is James Madison:

&gt;It has been objected also against a Bill of Rights, that, by enumerating particular exceptions to the grant of power, **it would disparage those rights which were not placed in that enumeration; and it might follow by implication, that those rights which were not singled out, were intended to be assigned into the hands of the General Government, and were consequently insecure.** This is one of the most plausible arguments I have ever heard against the admission of a bill of rights into this system; but, I conceive, that it may be guarded against. I have attempted it, as gentlemen may see by turning to the last clause of the fourth resolution.

The following is what he laid out in another Constitutional draft:

&gt;The exceptions here or elsewhere in the constitution, made in favor of particular rights, shall not be so construed as to diminish the just importance of other rights retained by the people; or as to enlarge the powers delegated by the constitution; but either as actual limitations of such powers, or as inserted merely for greater caution.

And this gives way to the final form of the Ninth Amendment:

&gt;The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.",1

We choose to accept implied powers and implied rights because no constitution can ever truly encompass everything that can ever be needed. 

&gt;In addition, while the Supreme Court is the theoretical final arbiter on Constitutional issues but that doesn't make the Supreme Court correct in its conclusions.

Of course, Plessy is proof of that. But should there be another another arbiter who can override the SCOTUS, then? At a point it becomes a question of practicality. 

Tyranny in all forms is generally bad (though I suppose we could argue that tyrannically stopping things we deem as morally atrocious is good.) 

The problem with the expansive rights argument is that I'm not sure that the Founders really did mean for it to be *implied* so much as amended. What correspondence do you think proves this case?",1
579,"The notion of an independent judiciary is a great theoretical concept but in reality the Supreme Court always considers how the population and the legislature feel about particular issues. They have to because as a branch of government they exercise no enforcement power. That's left up to the Executive Branch. The basis for the power of Judicial Review is itself rather historically tenuous. The Supreme Court knows that. Nothing in the Constitution grants the Supreme Court Judicial Review. Its not found in it. The Court gave itself that power.

In addition, while the Supreme Court is the theoretical final arbiter on Constitutional issues but that doesn't make the Supreme Court correct in its conclusions.

So while I agree with you that tyranny of the majority needs to be avoided, the undemocratic tyranny of the minority is also a problem. And in this case the majority want expansive rights while the minority want to restrict rights. In your historical example the majority wanted to restrict rights making it tyrannical. 

The Constitution is a document that facilitates ever expansive rights by design. Some Constitutional scholars will disagree but its as plain as day and the correspondence between the founders confirm it. The Bill of Rights were never meant to be an exhaustive list and that is why the Ninth Amendment was included even if it has been ignored by an inherently and institutionally conservative judiciary.",1

New data shows how ‘great replacement’ overlaps with other racial fears
  
Largely on the political right

  
Analysis by Philip Bump

The political utility of the “great replacement theory” is that it combines two potent, emotionally charged issues on the right. That “theory” — that there is a nefarious group of people hoping to bring immigrants into the United States to shift the nation’s politics to the left — overlaps with Republicans’ mistrust of Democrats and with often visceral opposition to immigration.
  

  
But there’s an important, barely veiled subtext as well, the subtext that explains why the “theory” is embraced by white nationalists. The opposition to native-born Americans being “replaced” isn’t opposition to blond-haired Swedish migrants sneaking over the border into Vermont. It’s opposition to non-White migrants edging out White U.S. residents. That, too, makes the “great replacement theory” espoused by people like Fox News’s Tucker Carlson valuable: It’s a way of talking about race without explicitly talking about race.
  


  

  
On Tuesday, Yahoo News released new polling conducted by YouGov that shows how fears of race overlap with acceptance of “great replacement.” Asked directly if they’d heard anything about the theory, only 40 percent of respondents said they had. Interestingly, Democrats were more likely than Republicans to say they had, perhaps because outlets such as Fox News don’t generally talk about the theory as a theory, while nonpartisan and left-leaning media outlets often do.
  

  
When asked about the central tenet of the theory, though, the partisan divide flips. While only about a third of respondents said they at least somewhat agree with the idea that “a group of people in this country are trying to replace native-born Americans with immigrants and people of color who share their political views,” more than half of Republicans said they do. Among those who say they voted for Donald Trump in 2020, more than 6 in 10 say they at least somewhat agree with that phrasing, with a quarter strongly agreeing.
  

  
What the Yahoo News-YouGov poll does next is important. They move from that question to two related ones: “Do you think that discrimination against White people has become as big a problem as discrimination against Black people in the U.S.?” and “are you concerned that native-born Americans are losing economic, political, and cultural influence in this country to immigrants?”
  

  
On each of those questions, about two-thirds of Republicans either agreed or were concerned to some extent. Nearly three-quarters of those who say they voted for Trump agreed at least somewhat that discrimination against White people is as big a problem as discrimination against Black people.
  

  

  
This is not a new finding, mind you. Since even before the 2016 election, there was documentation of Trump supporters’ fear about White people being a target of discrimination. Both attuned to and a member of his own base of support, Trump has made explicit appeals to that concern.
  

  
What the Yahoo News-YouGov poll does is show how all three of these things overlap. Republicans and Trump voters say that White people are facing significant discrimination and that native-born Americans are seeing their influence erode. They also think there’s an intentional effort to diminish the political power of native-born Americans in favor of immigrants and — more broadly — people of color.
  

  
Data provided to The Post shows the extent of overlap of those responses. Fully a fifth of respondents said they agreed with or were concerned by each of the three statements posed above.
  

  

  
The poll included another set of questions worth considering in the moment. The reason the pollsters asked about views of race and “great replacement theory,” of course, was the mass shooting in Buffalo this month. The alleged perpetrator of that deadly attack had apparently espoused “great replacement” as a rationale for doing so. It was the latest in a long line of politically focused acts of violence — acts that are much more often committed by those espousing right-wing views than left-wing ones.
  

  
When asked, though, respondents to the Yahoo-YouGov poll were divided in where they saw political violence as being more likely to erupt: a third said from the left, a third from the right and a third weren’t sure. Asked where past violence had come from, there was a divide: Democrats and those who voted for President Biden pointed at right-wing extremists while Republicans and Trump voters pointed at the left.
  

  

  
But of course, this is not simply a matter of opinion. Far more incidents have been linked to right-wing extremism than left, including the attack in Buffalo.
  

  
Those attacks often center on race.",1

I paid for college as I joined the military under the ""poverty draft"". I am the first college graduate in my family. I joined the military to pay for school. I grew up fearing debt, so I spent all my cash I saved in the military to get me through college. I came out the other side with zero assets and virtually no savings, putting me in a bad position, but I got through college without taking out student loans.

Now if we cancel student loan debt I essentially put in all that work for nothing? I should have just taken out loans? We need free education, we need a way to fix this problem we're in, but we need a more inclusive and broad approach.

The __insurrection was so much worse__ than Watergate.

Pugnacious demagogue and want-to-be fascist dictator / defeated one term President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__ did everything he could to keep America and the world from looking at evidence he was trying to hide.

He fought tooth-and-nail all the way up to the Supreme Court to try to keep us from having access to it.

__Second?__

The Supreme Court said Congress __could have access to the evidence.__ We recently obtained access within the last couple of weeks. It's a lot of data to comb through.

It's __quite obvious he was trying to hide something.__ 

__Third?__ 

__There are other things__ that he's kept back from the public, including the 15+ boxes that he took with him to Mar Largo. Some classified as higher than Top Secret.

__Fourth?__

The devastating ramifications of his accounting firm abandoning him and all of the accounting data / information they have on him? They basically said that the data could not be relied upon.

Meaning? Alternative facts are not part of the accounting firms reality.

All of these issues, and more (things we definitely don't even know about yet) need to be analyzed and combed through.

Look at the *""souls to the polls""* effort that has been going on for ~~years~~ **decades**. First, they were going to get rid of it, then they were going to *curb* it. So, while they added **mandatory** Saturday voting (I'll get to that in a sec), they also made Sunday voting **optional** (at the discretion of the election boards at the county level), so while many, if not all, of the metropolitan area counties, with large black populations, are likely to make Sunday voting available for its residents, there's a strong chance that any rural county with a small black population will decide not to let that happen.

On top of that....people work on Saturdays, too...so that hasn't helped them. The whole point for Sunday voting was to get the entire parish onto a bus and vote. So that just makes things more complicated.

But then there's [this chunk](https://doas.ga.gov/human-resources-administration/Announcements/Employee-Voting-Time) about the state requiring businesses' to allow their employees time off to vote, which one would think would be updated, since they've changed the previous voting hour requirement from 7a - 7p (which is now **optional**) to  9a-5p.

There is so much more than that going on.

The __draconian laws they are implementing__ changes everything about how we vote right now.

It's so much more than just providing valid identification.

There are __people who do not drive__ and do not have state issued identification. It actually costs money. Some people are too poor to get it. But that is just part of the laws passed.

&gt;Passed last March, Georgia's law requires identification for mail-in voting, makes it illegal to take food or water to voters waiting in line, and allows state election officials to take over the administration of county elections.

Voting Right Acts were overturned. They need to be replaced and made stronger.

If you research it? You would see that to be true. The __For The People Act__ would dramatically *strengthen our democracy* by making it easier to vote, ending gerrymandering, fixing our campaign finance system, and more.

Everyone should be able to vote. As long as they are eligible? The ability to vote should not be made more difficult.

In my state? Every single one of us votes by mail. There are no problems with voting by mail. We've done it that way since 1983. In 2011? It became law.

You can vote in person if you want to. And it varies by jurisdiction.

&gt;As one of five states - along with Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, and Utah - that conduct elections entirely by mail-in voting, Washingtonians haven’t had to go to a physical polling place since at least 2011. (Each county opens a voting center prior to each primary, special election, and general election, according to the Secretary of State.)

Loosing 60 cases (including cases in front of Republican judges) hasn't convinced you that you lost? No evidence as presented to the court in front of a judge was found to be valid. Impeached former President Trump and his minions lost every single case.

Not one case presented evidence that was valid. Repeat that to yourself again. Also? They have recounted / audited the votes. They found even more votes for President Joe Biden. 

They claim they can find no evidence of fraud in all of these auditing / Recount processes they're going through. So far? Not one.

There is no provision in the US Constitution that allows an impeached former president to throw out a newly elected president and do away with an election just because he:

■ is a sore loser

■ believes the votes weren't calculated correctly

■ believes there is some kind of machine interference

■ believes dead people voted.

Or __for any other reason.__

&gt;Donald Trump will not be “reinstated” as president by August, as some of his supporters and allegedly the former president himself seem to believe. But Republicans are rushing to change the rules to make it easier for their party to overturn the will of the voters in future elections.

GOP controlled legislatures have enacted horrible laws that will interfere with the way people vote. And how their votes are calculated. In some states? They have decided to do away with the role that the Secretary of State has to insure voter integrity and put a judge or a board in charge.

&gt;In five GOP-run states—Georgia, Florida, Kansas, Kentucky, and Montana—the legislature has usurped election authority that previously belonged to other state officials, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.

It's really happening.

&gt;Other GOP-controlled states have already changed their laws to make it easier to void election results. As part of its sweeping voter suppression law, Georgia’s heavily gerrymandered legislature removed Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger as the chair and a voting member of the state election board after he rebuffed Trump’s attempt to overturn Joe Biden’s victory. The legislature will now appoint a majority of board members, and the board, in turn, can take over up to four county election boards it deems “underperforming”—raising the prospect that Republicans could assume control of election operations in heavily Democratic areas like Atlanta’s Fulton County. In concert with a provision allowing right-wing groups to mount an unlimited number of challenges to voter eligibility, these changes will make it easier for Republicans to contest close elections and possibly overturn the results.

Dissatisfied parties can now go in front of a judge or some type of board they have newly founded ( never existed before until these new abhorrent laws were passed) and say hey I don't think this vote process was fair to me and I think you should do something. Because I actually won.

Then? With only the preponderance of evidence (not absolute clear and convincing evidence)? They can have the vote changed.

This was one of the reasons why impeached former President Trump lost his cases. He could not provide clear and convincing evidence. He had a lot of smoke screens, he said she said stuff, inadequate or false data, or people saying things (that is investigated turned out to be not true or alternative facts). Nothing that was clear and convincing evidence. 

&gt;The measure would also lower the burden of proof needed to demonstrate illegal voting, so that candidates only have to show a “preponderance of evidence” instead of “clear and convincing evidence.”

Which means? If you are a Republican or someone else running against another person, let's say a Democrat. And the Democrat wins? You can go in front of the board and say I don't think the count was fair and I should have won. And if the judge / board agrees? A new winner will emerge. 

Which means? Every single person that voted is basically being told your vote does not count, because we are going to put in who we want to put in, regardless of your vote.

This behavior and these new laws directly correlate with what impeached former President Trump and his minions were trying to do after he lost. He would go to all of these places and say hey can't you find some votes for me? He was __actually recorded saying these things.__ Evidence has been found, discussed, examined.

And guess what? There are no laws determining whether or not these so called board are made up of Independents, Democrats, or others. But I 100% guarantee you there will be a majority of Republicans on the board. Because this law was passed specifically to help the Republicans win and __in response to impeached former President Trump's ideology.__

Which is? If he thinks he won? Then he won. It __doesn't matter what the voters said.__

&gt;As the 2022 state legislative sessions begin, lawmakers have already introduced more new restrictive voting legislation than at this time last year. They have also continued to introduce bills designed to undermine the

Imagine throwing out votes because you don't agree with them. Because you think you or your candidate should have one?
 
&gt;""They could use this to overthrow the voice of the people,” Democratic state Rep. John Bucy III said on the House floor. “We no longer have to prove voter fraud to overthrow an election result, we can simply do it.” Though the bill failed to pass when House Democrats staged a dramatic walkout, denying Republicans the quorum needed to approve it, it is expected to be resurrected at a special legislative session later this year.

There are Republicans out there who are noticing all of these horrible new laws.

&gt;I’m very worried that now we have a new playbook that partisans across the country are going to start using to try to affect and influence the outcome of elections,” Washington Secretary of State Kim Wyman, a Republican, said on a call with reporters on Thursday. 

Helping people vote? Nope.  Making it to vote easier? Nope.

&gt;As GOP-controlled legislatures take control over election administration, they are also criminalizing efforts by election officials that would make it easier to vote.

Passing out water or food because you were standing in line to vote for hours on end? Nope.

&gt;Bills passed in Georgia, Florida, and Arkansas would make it a crime for volunteer groups to pass out water or food to voters waiting in line.

Guilty of __supreme direlection of duty,__ the demagogic temerity of pugnacious and want-to-be fascist dictator / defeated one term President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice) and the imbroglio he has foisted upon our country *knows no bounds.*

In a phone call (linked below in its entirety) with the Georgia Secretary of State and others? People should listen to the entire call. It is abhorrent to me that he thinks this way. Still thinks this way.

Never in my life did I think I would hear an elected official say things like this. His narcissism and bullying tactics come through.

It is one of the reasons why one term former President Trump was impeached. Because he stopped funding from going to Ukraine that had already been allocated by Congress. In a blackmail scheme.

&gt;Trump was impeached in 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The articles of impeachment were related, in part, to Trump's efforts to strong-arm Zelensky into launching politically motivated investigations against the Bidens ahead of the 2020 election and withholding vital military aid while doing so.
He wanted Ukraine to say they were investigating his political rival in order to get funds that were already promised.

Currently? We are sending additional military equipment specifically related to the Russian invasion.

&gt;President Joe Biden instructed the U.S. State Department to release up to an additional $350 million worth of weapons from U.S. stocks to Ukraine on Friday as it struggles to repulse a Russian invasion.

We are supplying much needed equipment to defend their country.

&gt;President Biden announced $350 million in military aid for Ukraine on February 26, two days after the invasion started. The package included anti-armor weapons, small arms, body armor, and other equipment, according to a senior US Defense Official. A Defense Official said later that it was""fair to say"" that US javelin surface-to-air missiles would be included in that package.

You have been told that the only way to be a good person, live a moral life is to be a good Christian.  It is beyond believe, it is truth, not logic, not action, etc.  It is something you know like the sky is blue.

How can that be?  Can it be that you CAN be a moral person who lives a good, successful life without being a Christian?   That is against anything I know, have been told.  It is against what the church wants you to ""know"" to be the truth.

So if you KNOW that is the only way to be a good person, and they are doing well, it is a big jump to think they have to be cheating, are bad, are successful because they are taking advantage?  Immoral?    Is it a big jump to think the powers in the church aren't going to be really upset if their flock has those beliefs?

Yet, Trump expects the Republican Party to pay for his expenses…that’s typical behavior of a narcissistic asswhole! I’ll tell you what Trump might not be so happy with the financial outcome because according to the news &amp; social media the number of supporters that Trump once had are quickly dropping in numbers!

Another loss might be far too detrimental to his mental health…Who da’fk would he blame for his loss…he can’t use election fraud again! 

When it’s all said and done Trump should be jailed TODAY for impersonating a President and interfering with Democracy!

1602,"In the D49 of Colorado Springs, a school board member (Jamilynn D’Avola) received an email from a student asking what she plans to do to help LGBTQ students in the school feel valued and heard. This was her response:


“Thank you so much for reaching out to me to voice your concerns. It is so good to hear from a student in the district! I can tell that you truly value your ideas and want to make sure that students are treated equally. I, too, want to make sure that all students are valued and treated with kindness and respect. You do not have to agree with someone in order to value them or treat them well. God cares very deeply about every person and wants them to know who they are in Him. Loving someone is not just about making them feel good. It is about helping them to see the truth so that the truth can set them free. It is about helping them to see who they are created to be, who God has called them to be. People are more than their backgrounds, the color of their skin, or their family circumstances. All people are created equal and no one can take that away from them because it was given to them by God. When someone fully understands who they are in Christ, then they will know they are valued and will be able to overcome depression and thoughts of suicide. They will know that there are only two genders and that there is absolute truth that comes from the Word of God. There is great freedom that comes from knowing the Lord Jesus Christ. He is the way, the truth, and the life, and no one comes to the Father expect through Him. It is for freedom that Christ has set us free, but with this freedom comes great responsibility. We are not free to do whatever we feel like, we must uphold the values and truth of the Bible. 

I know that you may not agree with me, and that is ok. I will still see you as the Lord sees you, as a child of the most high God who is loved and valued above all. You are unique, and God has given you special gifts and talents. I pray that God would reveal Himself to you so that you too can experience the love of the Father. 

Thank you again for being willing to reach out to me to voice your concerns. You sound like a really neat kid and hopefully I can meet you someday. If you and your parents would like to meet with me and another board member please let me know and we can set this up.

Thank you again! It was really nice talking with you.

At Florida's top tax rate (which Disney would be in) at 5.5% is 250 million dollars.  The truth is about the only thing that isn't taxable is salaries (which is significant at Disney) Best guess is around 9 billion would be taxable.  That is over HALF of the billion dollars that is recovered INSTANTLY.

Gov. Ron DeSantis’ is __angry at Disney because Disney pushed back against__ Florida’s Parental Rights in Education bill, dubbed by critics the “Don’t Say Gay” bill, recently signed.

&gt;*Florida House of Representatives on Thursday passed a bill that would dissolve Disney’s special improvement district, escalating Gov. Ron DeSantis’ attack on the company over its opposition to Florida’s Parental Rights in Education bill, dubbed by critics the “Don’t Say Gay” bill. The state Senate passed the bill Wednesday, after it was first introduced Tuesday. It will now go to the governor for his signature.*

Does he __ever think before he opens his mouth?__ Or is he like the rest of the GOP and just says whatever he wants at the moment?

&gt;*To fund the government services of Reedy Creek, Disney effectively taxes itself. While the precise tax flows of Reedy Creek are unclear, Scott Randolph, the tax collector for Orange County, said the Reedy Creek district collects roughly $105 million annually in general revenue. On top of the $105 million, Disney also pays local property taxes. Public records show Disney is the largest taxpayer in central Florida, paying over $280 million in property taxes to the counties between 2015 and 2020. If the special district is dissolved, Orange and Osceola counties would have to provide the local services currently provided by Reedy Creek. And, the $105 million in revenue would disappear, meaning county and local taxpayers would be on the hook for part or all of the added costs.*

Governor DeSantis has opened up a can of worms. His constituents will be responsible for this. __How are they going to afford it?__

He's basically telling a business - you better believe like I do or else. He is a want to be autocrat.

It's like he has a __vendetta against Disney.__

What if Disney decides to __move their theme park?__ I'm sure there are many states that would line up the red carpet for that.

And Florida would never be able to __replace all of the income and tourism__ dollars they bring in.

In the recorded conversation, McCarthy, a Republican, reportedly told a group of Republican leaders that he didn't believe Trump would voluntarily step down, and contemplated rallying Congress to have him impeached a second time, saying that he believed the measure would pass both the House and Senate.*

This __never happened.__

&gt;*McCarthy said he would alert the former president of his plans to begin an impeachment trial if he did not resign.*

McCarthy left his cajones deposited at the feet of Trump. Where __they remain to this day.__

Sometimes a single vote is consequential.

Virginia House of Delegates:

1971

The initial vote count had Republican William Moss ahead of Democrat Jim Burch by 1 vote for the sixth at-large seat in what was then a six-member district. But then a three-judge circuit court ruled that one of the ballots was ""defaced"" because the names of two candidates were crossed out with the notation ""Do not desire to vote for these two"". They did this even though the person who cast this vote (which was known because it was a signed absentee ballot) testified that he intended to vote for Moss. Throwing out the ballot created a tied vote. The names of the two candidates were placed in sealed envelopes, and a blindfolded Elections Board chairman plucked one from a silver loving cup. Moss won.

2017

The initial vote count had incumbent Republican David Yancey ahead by 13 votes. After a canvas that included provisional ballots, Yancey's lead was cut to 10 votes. Following a recount, Yancey trailed Democratic challenger Shelly Simmonds by one vote out of 23,215 cast. After review by a three-judge panel appointed by the Virginia Supreme Court, a disputed ballot that had been excluded as an overvote was instead counted for Yancey and the race was certified as a tie with the candidates to draw lots to determine a winner. The drawing of lots was later postponed after Simmonds asked a state court to reconsider the dispute ballot.  On January 4, 2018, the names of each candidate was placed inside a film canister, both canisters were placed in a bowl and one canister was drawn at random by State Board of Elections chairman James Alcorn. David Yancey won the draw and the seat, giving Republicans control of the House 51–49.



Massachusetts House of Representatives

2010

After Peter J. Durant was initially declared the winner by 1 vote, judge Richard T. Tucker ruled that one absentee ballot that was initially discarded was to be counted for Geraldo Alicea creating an exact tie.  Six months later, a special election was held where Durant beat Alicea by 56 votes.

You are correct, I am not a woman, and I do see how some women wouldn't want the opinion of a man in this sense. Carrying a baby is never a threat, but is often the consequence of some actions. Just as if a man gets a women pregnant, he has zero recourse other than pay.

Leaving it up to the states as they elect leaders who serve their views seems like a no-brainer and there are some instances where abortion should likely be the answer.

The police are a public service industry without public oversight or accountability.

A great example of this is civil forfeiture. If a police officer can in any way draw a bare minimum line that cash money in your possession *may possibly* have been used in a crime, there is zero due process for your cash being stolen by police. The burden is on *you* to prove that you earned it legally, and even then it may be months or years before you get your property back, if you even do get it back.

Good fucking question. 


&gt;I don’t have a specific policy remedy here; there may not be one. It’s not like Texas, or any other state for that matter, can outlaw cowardice. But I am generally uncomfortable with a legal-social framework that gives cops immense life-and-death powers, places few mandatory duties to serve and protect the communities in which they work, and then also gives them sweeping legal protections when they screw up. After Uvalde, a reflexive deference to officers’ split-second judgments and subjective state of mind makes even less sense than it did before.

&gt;This is highly polarized by politics and that is antithetical to the idea of the Supreme Court. No more secrets.

Supreme court deliberations are _meant_ to be secret while they're in progress, specifically so that political pressure doesn't influence the decisions. There's been plenty of cases where justices appointed by conservative presidents have voted in relatively liberal ways, such as Obergefell v.

This is a _really really_ bad move for a pro-choice justice or pro-choice clerk (or even one who is on thefence) because switching sides now looks like you're bowing to political pressure - and you don't want the appearance that the supreme court's legal decisions (which are supposed to purely be based on law) are actually able to be swayed by sufficient political pressure.

I wish I shared your optimism, but people have a short attention span, and plenty of conservatives will flip an ad like ""Republicans are after your daughters"" into a commentary on abortion ""killing many daughters before they were born."" Abortion is no different than any other political issue; interest in it waxes and wanes. Just like outrage after a mass shooting dying off within weeks, or months, these issues are difficult to materialize into political gains the further they are from elections. 

Why do you consider this person a hero? At best, they gave us a heads up about something which would happen regardless, and at worst they greatly exacerbated the issue by making it as bad as possible and weakening its political hold. Sure, the heads up gave a handful of states time to prepare laws protecting Roe, but it also gave plenty more states time to have bans ready for the second the decision is handed down, and you can weigh those two outcomes for yourself.

You claim to know what it means. The other poster clearly knows what it means. I certainly know what it means. We all know that we are all militia members, and we are all obligated to abide by the provisions Congress makes for the militia.

2085,"Yes, exactly. 

Read 10 USC 246.  

When you are done with that, read Article I Section 8, parts 15 and 16. 

The constitution explicitly permits ""the people"" to make ""a bunch of laws to democratically regulate themselves"". 

You can enact whatever training requirements you want on the militia.  If you want me to spend 6 weeks at boot camp to ensure I am qualified to carry a gun, you can do that. You can do that, but only by signing yourself up for that exact same training. . 

Personally, I think every high school student needs a minimum of 4 classroom hours on the laws governing the use of force, and another 2 classroom hours on safe gun handling. I fully support additional training requirements on the militia.",1
2086,"By all means, add regulations on the militia. I fully support **every member of the militia** receiving mandatory training on the laws governing use-of-force (in self defense or defense of others) and safe gun handling. 

Now, do you actually know who is in that militia? 

Read 10 USC 246. 

I'll summarize.  The ""militia"" referred to in the constitution is the whole body of the people.  Congress is empowered to enact certain provisions over the militia under Article I Section 8 parts 15 and 16. One of those provisions - the aforementioned 10 USC 246 - establishes two classes of the militia. People in either class are militia members.  The ""organized class"" is the national guard. 

The ""unorganized class"" is every person who has ever been required to register with selective service. That's me, probably you, and a very large percentage of the people reading this. 

The entity charged with ensuring the militia is properly regulated is Congress. They have not seen fit to ""regulate"" us very much at all. Selective service registration is the only significant regulation they have deemed necessary and proper to enact. 

If you don't think that you are properly ""regulated"" in your role as a militiaman, I would agree with you. I think we need the training I mentioned to begin with. 

So, by all means, let's regulate the militia ""well"", and I'll be attending right next to you at the next training muster.",1

&gt;*The House select committee investigating the Capitol assault has found that Navarro allegedly worked with former Trump adviser Steve Bannon and others to develop a plan to delay Congress' certification of the 2020 election.

Nothing like this has ever happened at SCOTUS. IMO it presses the envelope to the edge, for me at least?

What about the proposed ethics law for SCOTUS? When will they pass that? 

Rolling back a half century of abortion rights and privacy protections is disconcerting. And could lead to the dismantling of other rights.

&gt;*Supreme Court officials are escalating their search for the source of the leaked draft opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade, taking steps to require law clerks to provide cell phone records and sign affidavits, three sources with knowledge of the efforts have told CNN.*

There is no current law prohibiting the release of draft SCOTUS opinions.

&gt;*No federal law clearly prohibits someone with legal access to a draft Supreme Court opinion, such as a justice or clerk, from leaking that document to the press, legal experts said. A draft opinion is not classified, which is usually the grounds for leak investigations.*

Did they break into SCOTUS computer systems?

&gt;*Whether the leaker of the draft opinion overturning Roe v. Wade will face criminal prosecution depends on who they are and how they came to access the document. A hack into the Supreme Court’s computers, for example, would run afoul of the law.*

They could lose their license to practice law. Thats a __significant loss.__

&gt;*Other statutes, including around theft of government property, could potentially be applied if the leaker had legitimate access to the document, but legal experts said prosecutors would be unlikely to pursue those. Instead, the leaker would likely face professional consequences, including firing or the loss of a license to practice law.*

They need someplace to put their boats when they get there. No one is denying that they need someplace to put their boats.

My concern is for the wildlife that uses the water to live in, drink from and basically exist.

Since there is so little water and the boats are there?

It''s going to affect the animals that use it for water and the animals that live in it.

And the towns that rely on the tourists to help them through the winter? That money is not going to be there - because the tourists will stop coming. And they will tell their friends how awful it is there. And the word will spread.

That is really awful to think about. More people without jobs. More people without homes. More people going hungry. Towns getting abandoned. People moving away to find a better sustainable life.

And it all depends on the water. Which is being used by so many people in so many states and by the wildlife. Everyone depends on it.",1

&gt;*That’s when he realized how stupid his cult following was*

Who? Trump? Yep - he knows.

During the last months of his presidency, he started realizing the pandemic was killing off his base. So he got the vaccinations and he announced at a rally that it was a good idea for everyone. And __everybody booed him.__

They realized they had to enact even more dirty tricks and illegal maneuvering to try to change our laws in order to overcome the people's right to vote and pick their own candidates. And that's why all these new voting laws are coming into fruition.

They have actually passed laws that say if they don't like who was actually selected by the people? Some panel or judge can overturn the election, and they can put in whoever they want. Someone they like better. Someone who actually lost.

■ Some registrars have actually targeted senior citizens facilities and re-registered them as Republicans (from Democrats). 

• Someone actually recorded this as it was happening.

• All of these people had been changed from Democrat to Republican.

• So then they had to go change themselves back.

• What about other places where no one notices? And they go down to vote just to find out that its been changed tobRepublican?

■ They are also throwing away registrations and making it difficult to vote by mail.

GOP controlled legislatures have enacted horrible laws that will interfere with the way people vote. And how their votes are calculated. In some states? They have decided to do away with the role that the Secretary of State has to insure voter integrity and put a judge or a board in charge.

&gt;*In five GOP-run states - a*Georgia, Florida, Kansas, Kentucky, and Montana - the legislature has usurped election authority that previously belonged to other state officials, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.*

It's __really happening.__

Badically? Dissatisfied parties can now go in front of a judge or some type of board they have newly founded (never existed before until these new abhorrent laws were passed). Then? With only the preponderance of evidence (not absolute clear and convincing evidence)? They can have the vote changed.

This was one of the reasons why impeached former President Trump lost his cases. He could not provide clear and convincing evidence. He had a lot of smoke screens, he said she said stuff, inadequate or false data, or people saying things (that were investigated and turned out to be alternative facts).

&gt;*The measure would also lower the burden of proof needed to demonstrate illegal voting, so that candidates only have to show a “preponderance of evidence” instead of “clear and convincing evidence.”*

Which means? If you are a Republican or someone else running against another person, let's say a Democrat. And the Democrat wins? You can go in front of the board and say I don't think the count was fair and I should have won. And if the judge / board agrees? A new winner will emerge. 

Which means? Every single person that voted is basically being told your vote does not count, because we are going to put in who we want to put in, regardless of your vote.

This behavior and these new laws directly correlate with what impeached former President Trump and his minions were trying to do after he lost. He would go to all of these places and say hey can't you find some votes for me? He was __actually recorded saying these things.__ Evidence has been found, discussed, examined.

And guess what? There are no laws determining whether or not these so called boards / panels are made up of Independents, Democrats, or others.

But I 100% guarantee you there will be a majority of Republicans on them. Because this law was passed specifically to help the Republicans win and __in response to impeached former President Trump's ideology.__

Which is? If he thinks he won? Then he won. It __doesn't matter what the voters said.__

Imagine throwing out votes because you don't agree with them. Because you think you or your candidate should have won?
 
&gt;*""They could use this to overthrow the voice of the people,” Democratic state Rep. John Bucy III said on the House floor. “We no longer have to prove voter fraud to overthrow an election result, we can simply do it.” Though the bill failed to pass when House Democrats staged a dramatic walkout, denying Republicans the quorum needed to approve it, it is expected to be resurrected at a special legislative session later this year.*

There are Republicans out there who are actually noticing all of these horrible new laws.

&gt;*I’m very worried that now we have a new playbook that partisans across the country are going to start using to try to affect and influence the outcome of elections,” Washington Secretary of State Kim Wyman, a Republican, said on a call with reporters on Thursday.* 

Helping people vote? Nope.  Making it easier to vote? Nope. 

&gt;*As GOP-controlled legislatures take control over election administration, they are also criminalizing efforts by election officials that would make it easier to vote.*

Passing out water or food because you were standing in line to vote for hours on end? Nope.

&gt;*Bills passed in Georgia, Florida, and Arkansas would make it a crime for volunteer groups to pass out water or food to voters waiting in line.*

Guilty of __supreme direlection of duty,__ the demagogic temerity of pugnacious and want-to-be fascist dictator / defeated one term President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice) and the imbroglio he has foisted upon our country *knows no bounds.*

In a phone call (linked below in its entirety) with the Georgia Secretary of State and others? People should listen to the entire call. It is abhorrent to me that he thinks this way. Still thinks this way.

Never in my life did I think I would hear an elected official say things like this. His narcissism and bullying tactics come through. Loud and clear. Just like his recorded behavior in the article detailed above.

2680,"(1) No it's not insane. They actually *did* expand voting access in this case. You can't expect them to automatically stick with something that was done as an emergency measure.

Let's consider a different example and consider whether it's a ""silly argument"". 

Imagine you give extra social security benefits to people in an emergency situation--75% extra money say--and that when the emergency situation ends, you stop giving all that extra money as a special payment, but do have a 25% increase over the pre-emergency time.

Is that going backwards? Is that a benefits cut? It's not a ""benefits cut"" imo. It's just the end of special payments that were only supposed to be for a limited time. 

(2) That something was suggested and then withdrawn doesn't logically tell you motivation. I guess it may be suggestive in the right circumstances, but It's also within the realm of possibility that they had some other motivations and listened to objections and changed their minds.

(3) But you may have reasonable objections to such groups providing that service, without it having anything to do with you not wanting them to have water in that situation. It's not ""voter suppression"" if reasonable grounds exist for the rule, and you're perfectly fine with them having water in theory. 

It seems like you want to jump to them *must have* a bad motive for this. For the sake of argument, let's assume they do have a bad motive, and want to suppress the vote in a sneaky way: they still may be following a correct principle however. If something is theoretically correct as a principle and rule to use, then that can even be so regardless of bad motivations in voting for it. 

The best answer here, I think, is that you just shouldn't have long lines to vote in the first place, (I mean like hours waiting). So if you wanted to argue for more polling stations I could likely agree with you.

More drop boxes might help also I guess right? That could also be a good idea, assuming there aren't reasonable security concerns over them. But as I say, that doesn't mean I think it's ""voter suppression"" to cut the number compared to a special measure in an emergency situation. 

(4) You can somewhat decrease the time to apply, and it can still be a perfectly reasonable time period. 

As for voter ID laws, they are supported by a majority of the population from the polling I have seen, and even apparently by a large percentage of ethnic minorities. If there is public support for these measures, and you have to show ID for lots of other things, I don't see the big deal in having it for voting.

But it's a sneaky attempt to suppress the vote? 

Hypothetically even if some people *did have that bad motivation* it would still be the case that it has public support and plenty of those other people support it for reasons that have nothing to do with voter suppression.",1
2681,"Lots to unpack here and then I’ll be respectfully withdrawing because debating reality with people on the internet is not a favored past time. Moreover, you completely ignored the most important aspect, which is making it easier for partisanship to play a role in certification of results, which is the ultimate voter restriction.

https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-laws-roundup-december-2021

This is pretty comprehensive beyond the Georgia bill. But I’ll address the points on BBC.

1. Fewer drop boxes - the “counterargument” here is insane. “We didn’t used to use them, so reducing them to a fraction of the number used in 2020 is fine.” Just apply this to anything else and it’s a pretty silly argument. We have the ability to expand voting, choosing not to is restrictive…it’s literally going backwards. 

2. Voting on Sunday - they WANTED to eliminate this and only withdrew it out of external pressure…it goes to show exactly the motivating factor: to disenfranchise voters (specifically urban and black voters) without doing so *too* obviously. 

3. Water - Stymieing food/water to voters waiting on long lines is not at all mitigated by the   “but poll workers can.” That’s consolation text. They’re not the ones providing those things- it’s organized GOTV efforts.

4. Read the bottom - less time to request mail in ballots. Voter ID laws (see above: how can we target a specific group we don’t want voting, but discreetly??)

I live in a white upper-middle class community and vote without ID. I wonder why no one decries fraud here?

Regardless - the swathe of voter restriction bills and the empowerment of partisan bodies to overturn elections goes far beyond Georgia.

We need to increase access to voting, not restrict it. 

And IMO we start by making Election Day a holiday

It also has symbolic/religious and migratory connections to Ethiopia.  

Yes, Afro-Jamaican culture is ONE Black culture. It is not all of Black culture. 

Yes, there are other groups that have assimilated some aspects of Afro-Jamaican culture to a greater or lesser extent (Chinese, Indian, and European immigrants). They are Jamaican by nationality but not ethnically Afro-Jamaican. They generally do not speak the same language (Patwa and Koromanti versus English, Mandarin, or Hindi) and have varying religious and cultural practices. 

Having a Jamaican accent doesn’t make someone Afro-Jamaican. All Jamaicans are not Afro-Jamaican. Most of what foreigners recognize as Jamaican culture is Afro-Jamaican culture, and non-Black Jamaicans don’t have the same monolithic ethnic culture (even Black Jamaicans vary). 

It’s like Chinese culture. There are 54 different ethnic groups in China. They are all Chinese by nationality. They are not all ethnically Chinese. What we think of when we talk about “Chinese culture” (dragons, red envelopes, fireworks, dumplings, Mandarin) is really Han culture.

I live in one of those states with all mail voting.

We have no problem with this way of voting. None at all. As a matter of fact Fraudulent issues are few.

&gt;Between 2004 and 2010 in Washington, there were seven documented cases of vote-by-mail fraud, according to a Brookings Institution review of voter-fraud data compiled by the Heritage Foundation, which the Washington AGO cited in a lawsuit against the U.S. Postal Service—more on that in a bit. Most attempted cases of fraud were identified and stopped, Hunt said, such as a person who unsuccessfully registered their dog to vote. Additionally, “We regularly run the death rolls past the voter registration rolls to make sure we eliminate that.”

It's been fantastic during these last few years to have the comfort of vote by mail. 

I can study all of the candidates and issues at my leisure, and make my decisions on each candidate based on their philosophy,  past performance records and ideologies. 


I don't necessarily have to decide my vote in 5 seconds because I'm worried about whoever is behind me in line being bothered by the amount of time of my vote.

In the comfort of my home? I can drink coffee and watch the weather outside from my home. 


I don't have to venture out in a blizzard. Or, if it's in the summer? I don't have to stand in line for 10 hours in the heat. 


Why shouldn't Americans have the convenience of voting by mail? 


My state has been doing this since 1983. It was opened up for people who were elderly, disabled, or requested vote by mail. It became very popular very quickly.


In 2011, 38 of 39 counties decided to vote by mail and the legislature required vote by mail state wide.

There's nothing wrong with voting by mail.

■ Soldiers and students have been doing it for years. 

■ People who have to temporarily move to another location for a job but still maintain their homes because their family lives there? They've been doing it for years. 

It's called absentee voting. There is __nothing wrong with it.__
 
&gt;Five states - Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah and Washington - now have all-mail elections, in which ballots are sent to every registered voter without their having to request one. Others, like Arizona and California, allow voters to add themselves to a permanent list of mail voters.

I'm notified when my ballot is received.

The horror of my vote not being counted / received because of the Post Master General assisting his red headed friend by slowing down the mail?


It's abhorrent to me.

Trump has admitted to fucked up things his whole life, and in those cases he didn't get away with it,\* it's just that the punishment for those things is fines. And he's paid them. In that, to waive away the crime, he would say that he was doing what everyone else is doing, it's no big deal, and they're only afetr him because of who he is and jealousy or what have you (this is important).\*\*

When his business deals go South, investors eventually hire actual businessmen to take over, and  they pay Trump to fuck off--at a loss for him. Or, the business just quietly fails, like his magazine, vodka, water, steaks...The failure and scandal gets ink, but the resolutions aren't sexy, so they aren't front page news, so people are aware of the scandal, but not the resolution. Trump had to pay $25 million to settle a fraud lawsuit, and that fact didn't stick around too long, right?

As President, the public stuff he did violated established norms, and were seriously unethical at best, but the only punishment would censure and resignation in shame--but Trump is incapable of the latter, and the GOP wouldn't bother with the former.

Now, he's playing on an entirely different field, in an entirely different sport. Not only did he mishandle government documents, members of his administration (his kids, for sure) used unsecure private devices to conduct official business.

His financial crimes are charged in civil and criminal court, which has him trapped. If he pleads the 5th in the criminal trial, that can be used to infer guilt in the civil trial. If he pleads the 5th in the civil trial, that can be used to infer guilt in itself, but if he testifies that can be used in the criminal trial. *The Trump Family has no options.*

His accountants bailed, and do not stand behind ten years of returns. So he not only has no accounting firm (taxes are due!), he is unlikely to get another, *and he has admitted to undervaluing assets in writing.* 

And don't forget the ongoing case for election tampering in Georgia, which he has no Federal cover for, and the Governor couldn't stop the case even if he wanted to--quirk of Georgia law!

Trump is truly, absolutely fucked.

\*He would have faced criminal fraud charges, but he paid off the Florida DA, Pam Bondi, to ignore it.

\*\*He's doing it right now. His excuse his whole life when confronted with an obvious fuck up, is ""We did it all the time, no big deal"" or ""Everyone does it all the time, no big deal"" or ""I had no idea it was happening, but it's no big deal"" or even ""It was all this pathetic idiot I hired, it's his fault, but I fired him so it's no big deal."" But Trump can't grasp that he's facing serious, real-world crimes that don't involve just shady finances. So he is doing what he  always does, not realizing he is admitting to what he is being charged with.",33

&gt;Mike Flynn used the Kremlin’s talking points as he tried to blame President Biden for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

&gt;The statement itself is remarkable because it blatantly uses Putin’s talking points. The claim of ethnic problems in Ukraine is a lie. The idea that the Biden administration, which left the door open to diplomacy until Putin invaded, dismissed Russian security concerns is also a lie and Putin talking point. Flynn complained about Russia being demonized and claimed that Trump’s relationship with Russia was all a giant conspiracy carried out by the Clinton campaign and the Obama administration, which is also a claim that Putin made to cover his tracks with Trump.

I truly __can't believe__ that someone who wore the uniform for the USA, and claims the title of General on his letterhead/ stationary? Is now saying that he is on the side of Putin.

What is the world coming to?

I come from a military family (including father in law and children).

We were always taught that love of our American, the Constitution, and president came above all else.

If we had personal feelings about something? We would never say them out loud. We would keep it to ourselves or among trusted members of the household.

There's nothing wrong with disagreeing with administrative ideology / policies.

And even though he no longer wears the uniform? He should still abide by those rules.

&gt;Mike Flynn said that Russia is being demonized and blamed Biden for Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has outed the Putin co-conspirators on the right, from Donald Trump and Mike Flynn to Tucker Carlson. Mike Flynn and the others are putting it out in the open for the nation to see. Flynn, Trump, and the others are making it explicit that they are enemies of America.

As we always say in our household?

As Vladimir Putin ramps up his military offensive against Ukraine, not everyone is upset that the Russian bear is mauling its European neighbor. Across the American right, prominent figures from Tucker Carlson and Alex Jones to senate candidate J.D. Vance and CPAC star Tulsi Gabbard, have been cheering Putin on, broadcasting their disdain for Ukraine — or both.

Tucker Carlson

Fox News host Carlson has long toasted to Ukraine’s ill health. As far back as 2019, Carlson said out loud that he was for Moscow in its clash with Kyiv. “Why do I care what is going on in the conflict between Ukraine and Russia?” Carlson asked of a guest. “Why shouldn’t I root for Russia? Which, by the way, I am.”

As the end of that same show Carlson claimed he was “joking” (and was truly “only rooting for America”). But only a few days later, during a segment with Rep. Jim Jordan, Tucker voiced the same sentiment more clearly:  “I think we should probably take the side of Russia,” he said, “if we have to choose between Russia and Ukraine.”

Carlson’s public relations push on Putin’s behalf has been so fawning as to make an RT anchor blush. Later in 2019 he insisted, “The only purpose of \[U.S.\] aid to the government of Ukraine is to antagonize Russia.” Last November, he asked a GOP congressman: “Why would we take Ukraine’s side and not Russia’s side? Why?! Who’s got the energy reserves? Who’s the major player in world affairs?… Why wouldn’t we be on Russia’s side?”By December Carlson was insisting that Putin had good intentions in his clash with the West: “He just wants to keep his Western borders secure.” In January, Carlson asked, “Why is it disloyal to side with Russia but loyal to side with Ukraine? They’re both foreign countries that don’t care anything about the United States. Kind of strange.”

In recent days, Tucker spouted off on long monologues bashing “permanent Washington” for its supposedly irrational hate for Putin and affection for Ukraine, which he insisted was not a democracy but a “tyranny.” Hours before Russia’s invasion he doubled down: “Ukraine isn’t a democracy,” Carlson tweeted. “It’s a State Department client state.” (In the same show, Carlson attempted a bit of damage control: “Nobody on this show is rooting for Putin — or rooting for Ukrainians for that matter!” he said. “Always rooting for peace, for real.”J.D. VanceWhere Carlson boldly backs Putin’s thuggery, others on the right scoff a the notion that Americans should care a lick about Ukraine, often casting the Moscow/Kyiv conflict in terms of America’s own culture wars, suggesting Russia shares the values of the right while Ukraine has the taint of wokeness.

J.D. Vance — 

the shameless, Yale-Law-educated, faux-populist-turned-nativist GOP senate candidate from Ohio — recently blamed transgender advocacy for being at the root of of America’s anger at Russia. He insisted in an interview that he and his buddies “did not serve in the Marine Corps to go and fight Vladimir Putin because he didn’t believe in transgender rights, which is what the U.S. State Department is saying is a major problem with Russia.” (This is not the major problem with Russia, a state in which Putin’s regime poisons its opposition leaders.) Vance added: “I gotta be honest I don’t really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another.”

Alex Jones

The conspiracy theorist and Infowars host Alex Jones seems to have the same talking points as Vance when it comes to Russia and transgender politics, but he adds a demented George Soros topspin. Jones’ rhetoric is a bit hard to decode, but he seems to think Soros is promoting a liberal agenda around transgender rights in Eastern Europe, which in Jones short-hands as Soros seeking “to cut your son’s balls off.”

On Valentine’s day, Jones tried to deconstruct the geopolitics behind the Russia/Ukraine conflict, characterizing the West as the aggressor toward Russia. “The West is pumping the weapons in,” he said. “The West is starting the fight.” Jones added that Russian relationship with Ukraine is “like your big brother…comes in and beats you up on a routine basis.” But Jones normalized the attacks by saying of Russia ”it’s not the Huns,” while insisting that Ukraine would be better off — when the alternative is “George Soros that’s going to cut your son’s balls off, OK?” He added: “So you can have the Russians in there or you can have George Soros literally going after your children. That’s where we are right now.”

Tulsi Gabbard

The onetime Democratic presidential candidate turned CPAC “Reagan Dinner” special guest Tulsi Gabbard is well known for her anti-interventionist politics. But Gabbard’s pacifism has long been tainted by an undercurrent of affection for strongmen like Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin.

Beginning last year Gabbard began hyping the risk of nuclear war as reason not to provide backing to Ukraine: “Are we prepared to see our loved ones burn alive in a nuclear holocaust in a war with Russia over Ukraine?,” she asked on Carlson’s show last April.Now Gabbard is playing up Ukraine’s messy politics as reasons the West should let Putin have his way with the country. To be clear, Ukraine is not beyond reproach. Like many young republics it struggles with corruption and its elected officials often don’t behave in ways that would make France or Germany proud. But the democracy watchdog Freedom House gives Ukraine a global freedom score of 60 “partly free” compared to Russia’s 20 “not free.” (The U.S. scores an 83 “free,” for context.)

Gabbard insists that the “warmongers” are lying that Ukraine is a democracy at all, and thereby not worthy of protection. When Putin attacked the sovereign state of Ukraine on Wednesday night, Gabbard did not denounce Putin’s aggression, instead faulting the West for not meeting the Russian autocrat’s demands:",1

&gt;Legal pressures are mounting for Donald Trump’s ex-lawyer Rudy Giuliani as the US justice department and the House panel investigating the January 6 assault on Congress are both investigating a “false electors” scheme which Giuliani reportedly helped lead to overturn Joe Biden’s 2020 election.

IMO? Former NY Mayor Giuliani __should be disbarred,__ at the *very least.*

&gt;Former prosecutors say the justice department inquiry announced last month could pose a serious legal threat to Giuliani, given his role in helping orchestrate an electoral ploy in seven states that Biden won, involving replacing slates of legitimate Democratic electors with bogus Trump slates.

Falsifying documents and presenting them as facts is against the law. This is something that former NY Mayor Giuliani should know about since he has a license to practice.

&gt;The false-electors scheme is under growing scrutiny by federal and state investigators as one of the avenues Trump, Giuliani and other allies deployed in their aggressive drive to subvert the election result based on debunked charges of widespread voter fraud.

No __matter what former NY Mayor Giuliani thinks or says?__

&gt;Giuliani, who was subpoenaed by the House panel in January and is in negotiations about providing some testimony and documents, is one of more than a dozen Trump loyalists the committee has subpoenaed who reportedly were central figures in the stealth electors’ plan to nullify Biden’s election.

__Alternative facts never count__ when dealing with and living *within the realms* of reality. They __never have.__

When did it __become OK and acceptable__ to cheer on a dictator while he invades a soveriegn democratic nation?

&gt;At one white supremacist gathering last week, far-right racist Nick Fuentes and other Republicans were filmed cheering for Putin after he mounted the deadly invasion. Fox News host Tucker Carlson has openly said he's ""rooting"" for Russia over Ukraine. Republican Senate candidate J.D. Vance said he didn't care what happened to Ukraine one way or another.

I'm truly *shocked and embarrassed.*

&gt;This apathy toward the U.S.'s ally in eastern Europe continued through the weekend after retired Colonel Douglas MacGregor, a onetime Trump administration official, defended Putin in an interview with Fox News host Trey Gowdy.

D))+o you think it's really true that this person thinks it's okay for __Russia to basically invade another country?__ He is truly saying that Putin can *basically do whatever Putin wants* to Ukraine.

If it is Ukraine today? Who will it be tomorrow?

&gt;When Gowdy asked if Russia should be allowed to invade and claim dominion over any part of Ukraine it wants, MacGregor said: “Yes. Absolutely. I see no reason why we should fight with the Russians over something they have been talking about for years, and we chose to ignore it. And more importantly, the population there is indistinguishable from their own.”

It is abhorrent to me that __some American citizens__ who claim to be supporters of the US Constitution and freedom itself (and are __allegedly against__ autocracy / dictatorships) throw their support behind a dictator determined to destroy and conquer a sovereign democratic nation. A communist dictator determined to:

■ destroy freedom,

■ subjugate an entire country,

■ rewrite boarders at whim, and

■ wipe out its citizenry.

__It is truly offensive to moral sensibilities.__

WTF?

How can this person - a retired Colonel -  possibly say these things?

&gt;Former Trump Advisor Douglas MacGregor says we need to stop demonizing Putin, lift all sanctions, stop providing weapons and aid, that it’s “hopeless,” and just let Putin take whatever part of Ukraine that he wants.

Putin is destroying / bombing / upending apartment complexes, orphanages and hospitals and other infrastructure.

Why is Russian __dissemination of alternative facts__ permitted broadcast capabilities? I truly believe in *freedom of speech.* The line in the sand starts for me at the point of:

■ agressive action towards a soveriegn nation,

■ terroristic behavior,

■ crimes against humanity,

■ unprovoked terror, and

■ war crimes.

And why are __members of the Republican Party__ recklessly determined to *stand by and support* a dictator? Putin’s ideology is __against everything that our democracy__ supports and believes in.

&gt;MacGregor's advocacy for Putin didn't sit well with Fox national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin, who appeared on the network shortly after MacGregor's segment to correct his falsehoods.

There is __no doubt in anybody's mind__ on the planet Earth that __Putun is at fault.__ At least on the minds of people that __support democracy and freedom.__

&gt;Griffin told Gowdy: ""I feel like I need to correct some of the things that Col. Douglas MacGregor said, and I’m not sure that 10 minutes is enough time to do so because there were so many distortions in what he just said and talking about the West and NATO vilifying Putin and sounding like an apologist for Putin.""

&gt;Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) on Friday expressed regret for failing to vote to impeach former President Trump the first time over his dealings with Ukraine in light of the recent Russian invasion.

Clear and defining evidence was presented by the Democrats in regards to impeached former President Trump's attempts at blackmailing Predident Zelensky of Ukraine. And withholding funds for them that were clearly allocated by Congress. This is one of the reasons why he was impeached.

&gt;Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) on Friday expressed regret for failing to vote to impeach former President Trump the first time over his dealings with Ukraine in light of the recent Russian invasion.

Immediately after the vote? Former Senate Majority Leader McConnell made a speech regarding the guilt of President Trump. Immediately afterwards. Not:

■ one week afterwards,

■ five days afterwards,

■ six months afterwards.

But immediately afterwards. Former Senate Minority Leader McConnell made a speech, as detailed below.

&gt;""I want to be honest, in congress I have only a few votes that in [hindsight], I regret. My biggest regret was voting against the first impeachment of Donald Trump,"" the congressman wrote in a Twitter thread on Friday. Kinzinger explained that it was important for leaders to ""admit regret"" when possible. ""The bottom line, Donald Trump withheld lethal aid to Ukraine so he could use it as leverage for his campaign,"" he said. He further stated that Trump's exchange with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky in 2019 had lasting impacts on the country.""This is a shameful and illegal act, directly hurting the Ukraine defense today.""

Shame.

I imagine Rep. Kinzinger has regrets. He has admitted them.

&gt;Kinzinger, who announced that he will not be seeking reelection in the House, has been a vocal critic of Trump. The Illinois Republican serves on the House committee investigating the events of the Jan. 6 insurrection with fellow Trump detractor Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.).

We are all Americans and we can move forward.

Here is one of my favorite poems:

__Judged by the Company One Keeps__

One night in late October,

When I was far from sober,

Returning with my load with manly pride,

My feet began to stutter,

So I lay down in the gutter,

And a pig came near and lay down by my side;

A lady passing by was heard to say:

""You can tell a man who boozes,

By the company he chooses,""

And the pig got up and slowly walked away.

I have a really hard time understanding why members of Congress members refuse to vote for benefits meant to help people.

And then? When their state gets some of the funding? They shout out about how it's a wonderful thing.

Especially if they voted against something and / or re-worked something so that programs and initiatives that were meant to be passed to help us? Are scrapped on a  heaped pile of dust.

And then they add things like filler programs for their state -  taking money from programs that are needed by other people in the country. It's really abhorrent.

&gt;When the Senate finally passed its $1.5 trillion spending bill on Friday, sacrificing critical funding for pandemic control measures like coronavirus testing and popular climate initiatives like the Civilian Climate Corps, Sen. Joe Manchin was not left empty-handed. Despite serving as the lead obstructionist to President Joe Biden’s congressional spending plan, the West Virginia Democrat managed to secure $2.1 million for biomedical and behavioral research centers at West Virginia University - handing a healthy slice of the federal package to his daughter’s alma mater. “Many of the West Virginia priorities that I fought for,” he said in a press release, “are included in this omnibus legislation.”

So it seems the Apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

Especially when it comes to corruption and not caring about people.

&gt;While Manchin worked in Washington to secure funding for pet projects, his daughter was narrowly avoiding cross-examination. Also on Friday, a Kansas judge granted preliminary approval to a settlement in which the drug manufacturer Viatris, formerly known as Mylan, agreed to pay $264 million for antitrust violations pertaining to the marketing and sales of epinephrine, the lifesaving medication it uses to make EpiPens. With a final hearing set for July, the deal puts Heather Bresch, Manchin’s daughter and Mylan’s former CEO, on track to dodge legal repercussion from a yearslong saga involving allegations of racketeering, price fixing, and the anti-competitive sale of EpiPens — whose price jumped by nearly $550 under Mylan’s watch.

In regards to the EpiPen which has saved the lives of many people, including myself? Having the price rise to $ 550 right now because of her so-called leadership?

It's vomit-inducing crap.

Pretty disgusting.

It's like charging somebody $2,900 for insulin per month.

This might be a controversial opinion here, but the FBI is as much to blame for botching this case as the judge and jury members. Without their absurd overreach, some of these clearly violent defendants would've attempted similar actions and ended up behind bars. Instead the FBI wanted to push everything to the extreme, and wound up creating a case that was more focused on entrapment than the attempted overthrow and execution of an elected official.",1

&gt;*“We already knew a lot about this storyline, but today proved that there still is a potential for surprise - or more accurately, horror,” Rather wrote in a follow-up on Substack. “This is a smoking gun in the form of text messages between Ms. Thomas and the White House chief of staff at the time, Mark Meadows.”*

8MO? Clarence Thomas should not be near any of these cases. Especially with the __knowledge he has about his spouse__ contacting people in the administration - directly - in regards to the issues correlated to the insurrection

&gt;*The court rejected Trump’s attempt to block Congress from getting White House records related to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. There was just one dissenter: Clarence Thomas.*

&gt;*Thats what we say everytime. Its been three fucking years and we still havent gotten his tax returns. Fuck this system of endles appeals to waste time and money. He should have to pay all court fees for this.*

Actually?

__New York state has his tax returns.__

They __were actually able to build a case because they have access to his taxes__ now. Which he fought against every step of the way. Just like he does everything else.

There are civil and criminal lawsuits pending.

Cyrus Vance was the former DA. He retired after 12 years in office. He was very much interested in and encouraged his team to prosecute impeached former President Trump to the fullest extent of the law.

They were quite interested in filing a case against him until the arrival of new DA Alvin Bragg.

&gt;*A prosecutor who had been leading a criminal investigation into Donald Trump before quitting last month said in his resignation letter that he believes the former president is “guilty of numerous felony violations” and he disagreed with the Manhattan district attorney’s decision not to seek an indictment. In the letter, published Wednesday by The New York Times, Mark Pomerantz told District Attorney Alvin Bragg there was “evidence sufficient to establish Mr. Trump’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt” of allegations he falsified financial statements to secure loans and burnish his image as a wealthy businessman. “The team that has been investigating Mr. Trump harbors no doubt about whether he committed crimes - he did,” Pomerantz wrote.*

The two people on the team that were hired to prosecute impeached former President Trump quit their jobs. Because __the new DA did not support or agree__ with what they were doing.

&gt;*In his resignation letter, Pomerantz wrote that Vance had directed his deputies to present evidence to a grand jury and seek an indictment of Trump and other defendants “as soon as reasonably possible.” No former president has ever been charged with a crime. “I believe that your decision not to prosecute Donald Trump now, and on the existing record, is misguided and completely contrary to the public interest,” Pomerantz wrote.*

Impeached former President Trump has fought tooth and nail all the way to and back. Every /_kind of delay tactic and appeal__ you can think of.

&gt;*Pomerantz and his former co-leader on the Trump probe, Carey Dunne, resigned on Feb. 23 after clashing with Bragg over the future of the case. Both were top deputies tasked with running the investigation on a day-to-day basis. Both started on the probe under former District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., and Bragg asked them to stay when he took office in January. Both Vance and Bragg are Democrats.

Impeached former President Trump keeps appealing so that he can postpone the case - because he knows what is going to happen.

In December 2021, impeached former President Trump *(I like seeing this phrase a lot)* was __ordered to turn over his tax returns__ to Congress.

Of course he said no. So he is appealing.

Which he is __allowed to do, of course.__

Appeals take time.

When his appeals run out?

He really has to turn them over. His __accounting firm__ has deserted him. They have basically told the world that his tax returns can't be trusted. And __that is saying a lot.__

Except Russia. And a few other autocorrects he likes to people on speed dial.

&gt;*The Manhattan district attorney's office started investigating Trump in 2019, first examining hush-money payments paid to women on his behalf and then expanding into an inquiry into whether the president’s company misled lenders or tax authorities about the value of its properties.*

The two attorneys were so upset by what they perceived as an action on the part of the new DA? That they submitted their resignations.

&gt;*In his resignation letter, Pomerantz wrote that Trump should be prosecuted “without any further delay,"" noting that much of the evidence related to before Trump was president, that the investigation had already been prolonged by the tax return battle and other fights. Waiting to see if more  damning evidence could be found would likely be unfruitful, he wrote, and would only “raise additional questions about the failure to hold Mr. Trump accountable for his criminal conduct.” “No case is perfect. Whatever the risks of bringing the case may be, I am convinced that a failure to prosecute will pose much greater risks in terms of public confidence in the fair administration of justice,” Pomerantz wrote.*

Including the possibility for the *first time* in history of having __four women on SCOTUS__ at the same time?

The __amount of experience__ that Judge Brown has, her intelligence and bearing are exceptional.

She exudes class, decorum, and the habitual ability to listen. It's intrinsic to her very fiber.

I'm impressed that she has experience as a __defense attorney. __ Especially her experience representing people unable to pay for an attorney. We haven't had anyone with that much experience as a defense attorney since Thurgood Marshall.

It's incredible.

She will bring a different (and much needed) scope of experience to SCOTUS than its current configuration.

&gt;*On Wednesday, the lawyer Alan Dershowitz slammed Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, his former student, describing the lawmaker's questioning of the Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson as ""absurd.""*

IMO Senator Ted Cruz, like many Senators that approaced her with statements / questions, some appeared  __clearly out of line.__

&gt;*Describing ""modern leftist sensibilities"" regarding fluid gender identity, Cruz asked Jackson if she thought the ""same principle"" could ""apply to other protected characteristics"" such as race. ""For example, I'm a Hispanic man. Could I decide I was an Asian man — would I have the ability to be an Asian man and challenge Harvard's discrimination because I made that decision?"" Cruz added.*

Dershowitz, Cruz's __college professor_ said he was out of line basically.

&gt;*Dershowitz slammed the senator's ""series of absurd questions,"" adding: ""You can't change into somebody who's Asian. You can marry someone who's Asian and live an Asian life and be part of Asian culture, but no, you can't do that.""*

Setting aside some of the disgusting and dramatic departures made from what __would seemingly be a normal course of action__ when questioning a potential SCOTUS member?

It seemed at some points to be very much partisan based, contemptuous and inappropriate, IMO.

&gt;*Dershowitz also said it would be ""bigotry"" to ""discriminate against somebody who changed genders if they wanted to serve as a judge."" He added, ""People have the right to choose how to live their lives.""
Dershowitz said he hoped the senator didn't learn his style of questioning from Dershowitz as his student at Harvard.*

Numerous senators were very much out of line in the way that they addressed her, questions they asked, and how they questioned her experience. I'm not a lawyer, but I have been watching all of the hearings and __some of it was pretty disturbing to me.__

When it came to gender rights? Dershowitz made it clear that times have changed.

&gt;*""There's certain things you can change, certain things you can't,"" Dershowitz said. ""We used to think that gender was one of them. It turns out it's not! It turns out you can change gender and you can live a perfectly happy and good life.""*

Listening to some of the exchanges going back and forth, it was very __difficult for me to sit still.__ I actually *yelled back at the screen* when I thought something was clearly inappropriate. It was __beyond me__ how people could treat Judge Jackson that way.

The __hearings were somewhat divided__ along party lines in terms of the types of questions put forth.

It made me think about how Judge Jackdon felt sitting in the room with all those people. Judging her, asking her ridiculous questions, trying to make her feel uncomfortable. Trying to get a reaction from her.

And then? Presenting information (via this  public forum) to an audience (who may not know about certain things), as if it were truthful. And then __watching her try to answer and be diplomatic__ in her answers towards them.

Even though some of them were *pretty cantankerous,* to say the least.

&gt;*Cruz pressed Jackson on hot-button issues like critical race theory during the confirmation hearing. He also repeatedly defied Sen. Dick Durbin's instructions to stop questioning Jackson after his time ran out and complained that Sen. Lindsey Graham had been allowed to exceed his time by 10 minutes.*

I'm __very happy to hear__ that Dershowitz made his opinion known when he thought that Senator Cruz was in the wrong.

&gt;*Dershowitz's criticism of Cruz is perhaps surprising, given his previous praise for the senator. In 2016, Dershowitz said Cruz was ""one of the best students"" he'd had, adding that Cruz made ""brilliant arguments.""*

No matter what happens?

The fact that an African American woman with such __intelligence and widespread background__ is being considered for this position?

__Makes me very much proud__ to be an American today. And I am watching all of the hearings. I would like people to remember that Amy Coney Barrett was rushed through in 3 days.





The 35 days between the nomination and the 2020 presidential election marked the __shortest period of time__ between a nomination to the Supreme Court and __an election in U.S. history.__

&gt;*Democrats railed against the advancement of Barrett's nomination so close to Election Day, after the Republican-led Senate in 2016 refused to hold hearings for then-President Barack Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, nearly eight months before that year's election.*

4331,"Why are you copying and reposting a new comment thread when you respond to people? You understand how the “reply” function operates right? The whole point of having a continuous thread is so that you we can track a conversation. 

Let’s recap because you left the original post:

You said:
“The most important observation about this article? Is that people are not going to wear masks and people are going to think that it's okay not to wear a mask.” 

This is the part that I disagreed with saying that you were way off on your original estimation of this article. 

The you said: “I’m gOiNg To tElL mY UnCle YoU sAiD tHaT”.

Instead of responding to my next clarification you decided to respond by starting a new thread. So let me clarify again. 

The most important part of this article is that a Judge is challenging the CDC’s legal rights to inflict mask mandates on the general public during transportation. We are talking about a legal issue within the public heath and safety clause. The CDC has been claiming mask mandates fall under the “sanitation” guidelines. The judge threw out the mandate because she ruled this to be untrue. You took this as a personal attack and turned it into “people are going to think it’s ok to not where masks”. 

I disagree with the judges assessment, but I also disagree with yours. We are at a point in this pandemic where masks should not be mandatory. I believe they still make a difference and should be encouraged, but mandates just invoke peoples rebellious attitudes towards authority. You decided to make this issue all about you, and your scared, I get it. But humanity will prevail, as we always have. Please have a good day, I have to go to work.

All told, my views are somewhere around 75% liberal, 25% conservative, vasty simplified.

4414,"Specifically Terri Schiavo.  

Back in the day, there were two Republican parties:  There was the big part, which was ostensibly focused on making the United States the best it could be by making the United States economy the best it could be, and there was the little (and loud) part, which was focused on the culture wars.  It was the crazy uncle part of the party which the rest of the Republicans did their best to pretend didn't exist. 

That little part got harder for me personally to ignore when all the mean-spirited anti-LGBT, FRC/AFA, Conservative Christian stuff really picked up steam in the 1990s, and the ""Moral Majority"" started getting real power in the Republican Party.  

The final straw was with Terri Schiavo... when Republicans in both state and federal congresses passed what was essentially a Bill of Attainder (an act of Congress specifically targeting only one person) with full knowledge and understanding that what they were doing was unconstitutional... when Congress essentially took away a husband's law-given rights to make medical decisions for his brain-dead wife in order to please their base.  

That was when I realized that the Republican party no longer was being restrained by the bulwarks that the founding fathers had laid out in the Constitution.  That was when I realized that the Republican party was only focused on performative actions designed to ""energize their base"" (whoever that was).  That was when I realized that the little part of the Republican party had completely seized control from the big part of the Republican party.

Deep down, I'm still an old-school, pro-business, economy-focused, Rockefeller Republican, but there is no way in hell I can vote for a political party that sees the foundational rulebook of American governance as a nuisance, and does everything they can to weaken it, ignore it, or circumvent it.",1

I agree with people's criticism of all the churches and denominations that confuse being Christian with being Republican, and threaten their adherents with hellfire for voting for Democrats.  I sometimes refer to some of the Roman Catholics who fall into that category as Republicatholics.

I'm just saying that, contrary to what those conservatives try to tell people, you can leave the Republican Party without leaving the Christian faith, and without having to compartmentalize your faith from your politics.

4420,"Just as an interesting historical note, the Iraq War is also what turned a gentleman named Jim Webb, who had been Secretary of the Navy under President Reagan, into a Democrat.

Webb would go on to run for the Senate in the state of Virginia as a Democrat in 2006, wearing the combat boots of his son, who was active duty military at the time, following in his father's footsteps (Jim was a veteran).  Webb's first advertisement of the campaign was of President Reagan praising his military service.  Webb's opposition to the Iraq War was the key issue he campaigned on.

Webb was considered an underdog in that campaign, but you could see the early returns coming out of rural southern Virginia counties, which were traditional Republican strongholds, only had him losing roughly 60% to 40%.  That may seem like a lot, but 40% was a lot more than most Democrats got down there back then.  The television announcers were acting like it was almost over and the Republican incumbent George Allen was on his way to re-election, but they weren't paying close enough attention to where the votes were coming.  I say that margin and said he was looking like he may have won the state, because the vote that had not yet been reported was largely in northern Virginia DC suburbs, while lean Democratic, and some cities in central and southern Virginia like Richmond, which lean Democratic within the city limits.

Obviously, Webb won, and Virginia has had two Democratic Senators ever since.  Also, then-Senator Obama won the state of Virginia in the 2008 Presidential general election, and every Democratic candidate for President since then has won re-election.  Sure, they elected a wing-nut Republican Governor last year, so it's probably still a purple state, but it's a purple state that leans blue.  Before 2006, it was considered a red state.

That 2006 race was actually very important nationally.  The Democrats were considered very unlikely to retake the Senate, but won a couple of seats they weren't expected to, and so very late at night or early in the morning, control of the Senate was coming down to Virginia results that were extremely slow coming in and a race in Montana, which was just in a different time zone and thus couldn't start counting the vote until late.  Around 4:15am ET I declared victory for Webb in Virginia and Tester in Montana (Also a Democrat) and went to bed certain that the Democrats would have a Senate majority in January of 2007 (Albeit a slim one, I think it was 51 to 49).

Within in a week, President Bush had come out in a blue tie and talked about having heard the American people and wanting to work with the new Democratic majority.  Donald Rumsfeld, the Secretary of Defense who had helped orchestrate the Iraq War, resigned, and was replaced by Bob Gates, who, though a Republican, was less of a hardliner and respected enough among Democrats that President Obama kept him on for the first year of the new administration.",1

4427,"Here we go.

I was conservative back in the days of Reagan and the Bushes.  They talked a good game, and their message resonated with people.  Work for what you get.  Obey the law.  America is great.

It was all just superficial patriotism.  I listened to Rush, and watched Fox, but I'm remembering them as being sane, at least.

Then little by little, even Fox was showing the ugly side -- which they saw as the good side.  Republicans were voting against working class people, and poor people more and more.  They voted for legislation that took away protections, and made the middle class life out of reach more and more.  Even though I was still not even close to wanting to be a Democrat, I'd turn to my wife during newscasts, and say ""why the hell are they doing this?  These are supposed to be the good guys.""  For the record, my own personal situation was not affected by this.  I wasn't basing my opinions on my own needs, but that of others.

Anyway, in the 2006 mid terms, I voted for Democrats for the first time.  My wife couldn't believe it.

But wait.  There's more.  Rush Limbaugh used to talk about this awful website called Democratic Underground, and he shared the most outrageous views that he could glean from the site.  I guess he figured his followers wouldn't check it our for themselves, but I went to DU, and had a hard time finding anyone who felt the way Rush said they did.  Granted, he cited actual quotes by DU users, but that's what they do -- they find one radical, then declare that *tHiS iS WhaT tHeY aLl ThInK!!!!1!*  

No.  Almost none of them felt that way.  I found myself agreeing with them more than I agreed with conservatives.  And despite Rush's assertions to the contrary, their views were backed with documented facts, while conservatives views leaned toward emotion and hearsay. (for the record, the DU community has too many jerks in it, but I still agreed with their politics).

And yes, there's more.  Two years after my first time voting for Democrats, they introduced Sarah Palin.  I think that's what cemented my decision to move left.  I thought they had hit rock bottom.  Now I fear there is no bottom for Republicans.

Notice I never mentioned conspiracy theories or Nazis?  Those weren't even on the radar back then.  They continue to circle the bowl, deeper and deeper into the sewer.  They don't allow each other to have opinions that don't follow the party line.  They have cookie cutter beliefs, and they repeat the same catch phrases without putting any thought into what they believe.",1
4428,Losing my religion,1
4429,"I consider myself non partisan, but in general lean towards left a bit more. 
There wasn’t any one thing that made me change my views. It was really a slow progression of seeing and hearing the lives of more diverse people and perspectives that deteriorated the mental picture I had painted about the world. 

The hardest thing to overcome was my religion. I grew up in a very religious Christian household and community. So a lot of the political beliefs are closely tied to religious ones. Some of the early cracks started forming when I started studying the Hebrew/Greek meanings of biblical verses and digging into the historical context. I started questioning whether or not we were skewing our understanding based off our own cultural perspective with my paster. The paster obviously didn’t like those questions and basically told me to stop digging into that info. 
The next big thing was when my friend was discharged from the army after serving 6 years of combat on the frontlines of the Iraq/Afghan war. The church would always praise how much they live our troops, but when my friend came back and had clear and severe PTSD and was struggling to readjust back to society. I watched as church leadership tried to push him out because he asked too many questions and cussed too much. This started making me look at how the church actually acts on what they preach. That’s when I noticed that they would actively avoid homeless, and anyone who wasn’t like them they’d just try to conform and talk down to. 

I really just wanna be a good person at the end of the day, and it was obvious that I couldn’t be if I followed their practice. So I started thinking on my own and questioning everything, including politics, with the goal of what’s gonna bring the most net positive to others. So that’s also why I’m not Left. I’m not gonna adhere to any group that’ll try to regulate my free thought",1

4435,"I wasn't just conservative, I actively worked on political campaigns and ran in a primary.  

I grew up under Nixon, so definitely became more left.  But Carter was honestly a terrible president.  He soured me on the Democrats.  In 1980, along came Ronald Reagan who seemed like he had all the right answer and he had the right people: former members of Congress, people who knew how the system worked and was supposed to work. 

It didn't hurt they were Hollywood Glamorous, too.  After four years of a big show about recycling her governor's inaugural gown and other performance theater, we realized they were nice people but dull.  

At the time, the Republicans seemed to have learned the lessons about what Nixon and the party did wrong.  There were alarm bells: Lee Atwater was a nightmare of a human being.  We had a lot of the state parties that were miles beyond him in terribleness. 

Then, in 1986 we had the revelation that the NSC was running a back room clandestine operation to trade weapons to Iran to raise money for the Nicaraguan Contras.  This was an explicit violation of federal law.  How the heck did two knuckleheads get away with it?  We never got that answer because it turned into performance theater.  I was starting to wonder if this was just a part of the problem or the party itself. 

In 1992, two years before the Republican wave that took the House - I ran in a primary.  I ran on civil rights, pro-immigration  For those who weren't in class that day, these used to be the position of the republican party.  But, in the primary I got lambasted as a leftie.  I gave as good as I got since I was the only military veteran running and I would ask them how they served their country with their student deferments?  

By 2000, I had real doubts and considered voting for Al Gore.  I wish I had.  By 2004, the republicans turned back to Culture Wars just as they had in the 1964 and I was done.  I changed my registration to independent and four years later, changed to Democrat.

""What sharply distinguishes the abortion right from the rights recognized in the cases on which Roe and Casey rely is something that both these decisions acknowledged: Abortion destroys what those decisions call “potential life” and what the law at issue in this case regards as the life of an “unborn human being.” See Roe, 410 U.S., at 159 (abortion is “inherently different”); Casey, 505 U.S., at 852 (abortion is a “unique act”). None of the other decisions cited by Roe and Casey involved the critical moral question posed by abortion. They are therefore inapposite.

The US has defined that through liberalism. The belief that all people are created equal, and should have equal access to justice, opportunity, and peace. We derive that authority from the people who are governed. and provide a process for the people to then change and update that governance through elections.",1

People are placed on that white supremacy hierarchy based on if their values align with the values of those at the top, and if they meet certain financial, or familial ties to be valuable.

White supremacy is just the opposite of freedom and justice for all. It is the commitment to a system that protects one group but does not bind it, and binds one group and does not protect it.

‘An obstacle to taking any action’  
For McConnell, 2018 opened with a mass shooting at Marshall County High School near Benton, Ky., where a 15-year-old student killed two and injured more than a dozen others that January. The following month, another school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., left 17 dead and drew yet another national outcry for stronger gun measures.  
At the time, Trump offered messaging whiplash. In a meeting with Democratic and Republican lawmakers two weeks after Parkland, he called for “comprehensive” gun legislation and chided Republicans for being “petrified” of the NRA. But the next day, he hosted an NRA lobbyist in the Oval Office, declared the meeting “great” on Twitter and seemed to lose interest in working on gun legislation.  
Still, a McConnell aide said, the combination of the Florida and Kentucky school shootings prompted McConnell, by then the Senate majority leader, to help pass two modest bills on background checks (the Fix NICS Act) and school safety (the Stop School Violence Act).  
The Fix NICS Act helped improve the criminal background checks system to make background checks more thorough and accurate, and the stopping school violence measure authorized additional funding for improving school security and early intervention and school violence prevention programs.  
Another big push for gun legislation came in the summer of 2019, following back-to-back shootings on Aug. 3 and 4 at a Walmart Supercenter in majority-Hispanic El Paso and in a nightlife corridor in Dayton, Ohio, which left a combined 23 people dead and dozens more injured.  
The Democratic blowback was fierce and directed squarely at McConnell — who was again campaigning for reelection — since the House had already passed a background check bill.  
“I hope that Sen. McConnell would bring the Senate back tomorrow and pass the background check bill and send it to the president,” Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown said after the shootings.  
The same day, Shannon Watts of Moms Demand Action, a gun violence prevention group, declared, “We need Mitch McConnell to allow a vote.”  
The Twitter account of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) retweeted both statements, and several days later, Pelosi wrote a public letter to Trump asking him to call on McConnell — whom she described as “an obstacle to taking any action” — to call the Senate back into session.",1

4830,"Part 2:

In 1990, the year after the Standard Gravure shooting, McConnell was up for reelection and found himself in a close race with Democrat Harvey Sloane, then the Jefferson County judge executive and a former Louisville mayor, who had called for banning assault weapons.  
In 2013, following Sandy Hook, Sloane recounted in Louisville’s Courier-Journal newspaper that as his race with McConnell tightened in the final stretch, McConnell and the National Rifle Association “blistered the state falsely as to how this ban would eventually take away ‘your hunting gun and the hand pistol you need for personal protection.’ ”  
McConnell defeated Sloane by five percentage points and, in his second term in the Senate, went on to vote against both the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act in 1993 and the Federal Assault Weapons Ban in 1994.  
“Mitch is really Machiavellian,” Sloane said in an interview with The Washington Post last week. “He’s single-handedly held up any kind of gun legislation that’s meaningful.”  
‘It didn’t change a thing’  
In September 2019, a group of gun-control advocates — including Kris Brown, the president of Brady, a gun violence prevention organization; Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), a civil rights icon; and Rep. Lucy McBath (D-Ga.), who lost her 17-year-old son in a 2012 shooting — gathered on the West Lawn of the Capitol for a rally in favor of tougher background checks.  
After the rally, some in the group — which also included some McConnell constituents — decided to make their way to the then-majority leader’s office for what Lewis might have called “good trouble.”  
“So we walked over, John Lewis kind of leading us, talking about the importance of peaceful resistance,” Brown recalled, adding that Lewis asked if someone should get Depends — a brand of adult diapers — because the group might be there for a while.  
“His staffers had no idea what to do with us,” Brown said. “McConnell didn’t have the human decency to sit down with John Lewis.”  
Instead, a McConnell staffer ushered the group into a conference room and met with them for over an hour. Brown said that the staffer clearly seemed moved by Lewis, telling him that she held him in high esteem, and by the victims of gun violence, who recounted their stories one after another.  
“She was moved to tears, but it didn’t change a thing,” Brown said, saying the staffer essentially told the group “that it was just the wrong time to bring this bill forward.”",1
4831,"Part 1:

Mitch McConnell was just finishing up his first term as the junior senator from Kentucky when a mass shooting rocked his hometown of Louisville.  
On Sept. 14, 1989, a disgruntled employee entered the Standard Gravure printing plant in downtown Louisville and, armed with an AK-47 and other guns, killed eight and wounded 12 others before taking his own life — in what remains the deadliest mass shooting in the state’s history.  
At the time, mass shootings had not yet become the staple of American life that they are now, and McConnell said he was “deeply disturbed,” declaring, “We must take action to stop such vicious crimes.”  
But he also added: “We need to be careful about legislating in the middle of a crisis.” And in the days and weeks after, he did not join others in calling for a ban on assault weapons like the AK-47 used by the shooter.  
The Standard Gravure massacre provided an early glimpse of how McConnell — now the Republican Senate minority leader — would handle mass shootings and their aftermath over the next three decades, consistently working to delay, obstruct or prevent most major gun-control legislation from passing Congress.  
McConnell would go on to follow a similar playbook time and time again during his seven terms in Congress, offering vague promises of action, often without any specifics, only to be followed by no action or incremental measures that avoided new gun regulations. As a Republican leader, he also helped dissuade his conference — as after the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. — from supporting gun legislation and, as majority leader, refused to bring up significant gun-control measures for a vote.  
Now, the latest devastating and high-profile mass shootings — a massacre Tuesday at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Tex., that left 19 students and two teachers dead, just 10 days after a racist slaughter at Buffalo supermarket that killed 10 — have thrust Congress back into a fiery debate over what, if anything, lawmakers can do to curb gun violence.  
On Thursday, McConnell told CNN that he had encouraged Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) to reach out to Sens. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) — who made gun control a personal project after Sandy Hook — to begin discussing what bipartisan measures might be possible.  
But many Democrats and anti-gun advocates remain skeptical, predicting that McConnell and his fellow Republicans are poised to obstruct any consequential gun-violence-prevention bills yet again.  
“If there’s any one individual in the United States to blame for our inability to put things in place to prevent gun violence, it’s Mitch McConnell,” said Peter Ambler, the executive director of Giffords, a group devoted to fighting gun violence. “McConnell understands he’s hostage to that extreme base that just doesn’t tolerate any departure from any of their views.”  
Many Republicans say that McConnell is less a singular obstacle than a savvy leader who is able to his read his conference and make decisions that help his senators and protect them politically. “McConnell knows where his members stand and makes the tough calls to protect their interests,” a senior Republican aide said, explaining McConnell’s overall motivations in addressing gun violence and gun legislation.

Not only that? What is next? Whose rights will be abolished next? Taking away rights from all of us a little bit at a time is how an autocracy starts. Think about it. Our children and our children's children will not have the same rights that you and I had growing up.

&gt;*On Wednesday, the Supreme Court abolished individuals’ ability to sue Customs and Border Protection agents who violate their constitutional rights. In the process, the conservative supermajority came close to smothering lawsuits against all federal officers who defy the Constitution, granting them near-impenetrable immunity. The liberal justices, in dissent, took the extraordinary step of identifying the cause of this disturbing development: the addition of new justices appointed by Donald Trump.*

A __public discussion like this has never happened__ before. Where a sitting justice of SCOUS  justice has come forward and actually stated that because of the makeup of the Court calls are being changed. And not for the better.

&gt;*Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s dissent, joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan, castigated the majority for shredding precedent in its quest to immunize federal officers from civil suits. The justice complained that “a restless and newly constituted court” rewrote the law to ensure that victims of federal police brutality have no redress. She also drew attention to the reason for this shift: the replacement of Anthony Kennedy and Ruth Bader Ginsburg with Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, whose addition moved the court far to the right.*

So now the public can get insight into what's going on right now. And we really need to start thinking about what we need to do.

&gt;*It is exceedingly rare for a justice to call out their colleagues in this blunt manner. Doing so shatters the myth of the Supreme Court as a unified, apolitical institution with special knowledge of constitutional truths, instead painting the (far more accurate) picture of nine lawyers who exercise raw power to achieve their preferred policy goals. Adherence to precedent, in contrast, promotes not just stability but also an appearance of impartiality rooted in the justices’ willingness to stand by past rulings. When the court abandons this principle, it looks more like a superlegislature whose political composition alone drives its decision-making.*

Good.",1
4901,"Things are different within SCOTUS.

&gt;*At the Supreme Court, nothing is as usual this term after the leak of Justice Samuel Alito's draft opinion in the biggest abortion case in nearly a half-century. Normally at this time of year, the justices would be exchanging hundreds of pages of draft opinions and working with each other to resolve differences and reach consensus in the most challenging cases of the term. Instead, the court is riven with distrust among the law clerks, staff and, most of all, the justices themselves.*

My question? Why would Justice Thomas lose his face in his colleagues what have his colleagues done to him that makes him think he can't trust them I would think it would be the other way around with what is going on with his wife  Jenny Thomas, and her clear support and involvement in the insurrection fiasco.

&gt;*The atmosphere behind the scenes is so ugly that, as one source put it, ""the place sounds like it's imploding."" To cite just one public example, Justice Clarence Thomas in a speech a few weeks ago seemed to say he no longer trusts his colleagues. ""When you lose that trust, especially in the institution that I'm in, it changes the institution fundamentally,"" he told a conservative group. ""You begin to look over your shoulder. It's like kind of an infidelity that you can explain it but you can't undo it.""*

Are ongoing investigations. However no one at SCOTUS is used to doing these types of investigations. Their job is to protect SCOTUS. I think they should bring in outside help to show them how to do a proper investigation. And to make sure we get the answers that we need.

And then, of course, there is that SCOTUS decision eight years ago that cell phones can't be confiscated or delved into without warrants.

&gt;*Roberts wrote the court's unanimous opinion, saying that modern cellphones are not just another technological convenience. They are a compendium of everything in a person's life — your political preferences, interests, hobbies, medical records, where you have been and with whom. ""Allowing a warrantless search of all this information is not just an incidental intrusion like a peek into a cigarette pack,"" he said in summarizing the opinion from the bench. ""It is a significant invasion of privacy.""*

So many things are going on at SCOTUS right now. We need to really pay attention. We need to think about changes that we might need, as constituents, to suggest that Congress considers. We need to think about ethics.

&gt;*As for the court itself, it is not in a good place. ""I don't know how on earth the court is going to finish up its work this term,"" said a source close to the justices. The clerks, he explained, are sort of ""the court's diplomatic corps."" Especially at this time of year, they talk to each other, with the approval of their bosses, to find out how far the envelope can be pushed in this case or that one — or conversely, how can we soften language to get five justices on board. But at the moment, he noted, the clerks are terrified that their whole professional lives could be blown up, so they aren't able to do that. In short, it's a very perilous time for the Supreme Court.*

The SCOTUS Ethics Act should be established.

5237,"Well, I wouldn’t say I’m a leftist but I’ve gone much more center than I used to be. And what’s ironic is I used to be a devote far leftist with all the communist rhetoric and all, although in recent years I realized that communism has done nothing but be harmful to the millions of people who lived and currently live under it so I flipped right to conservatism. I initially saw it as a good thing because I strongly believed in American values and I have a lot of pride in my country. I was ok with stronger enforcement of borders and domestic industry and enterprise. 

However, in recent months I’ve begun a drift towards the left, and I would say I sit in the middle, and depending on the topic I lean more left or right. But I feel I lean more left now because of who I surround myself with. Now don’t get me wrong as someone who enlisted in the military I’m practically surrounded by people who are on the right end of the political spectrum, but those who I call friends are more on the left. We would frequently get into discussions about the current political climate of the US, much of this surrounded the protests and riots that happened in the wake of the Election, BLM, Covid, and other events within the last two or so years. 

But with all of that said as I’ve talked with my friends, two of which have recently told me they were trans which was both a shock and something I wasn’t entirely prepared for and if I’m being honest still coming to grips with. And many of their points were very clearly in favor of fairness and justice for everybody, and while some of the words they used weren’t the best but I understood the meaning behind them. 

Another thing is the conservative media's total incompetence and frank unawareness of the modern world around them, although I think it would be safe to say that applies to all media regardless of political affiliation. But the largest offender for me with conservatives is their obsession with religion. I can't for the life of me figure out why they have this idea that America needs Christian values to be successful or prestigious. Now I completely agree with the first amendment and their ability to worship whatever god they choose, but it seems they want to force it on you. Turn you into this model citizen with Christianity at the forefront, and just disregarding the fact that we have the right to worship any god we so choose.

Supreme Court Bans Recovery for Emotional Harm in Discrimination Suits

Splitting 6 to 3, the court ruled that facilities receiving federal money cannot be sued under four federal laws for discrimination that causes emotional distress.

By Adam Liptak

April 28, 2022

WASHINGTON — Dividing 6 to 3 along ideological lines, the Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that victims of discrimination that is forbidden by four federal statutes may not sue if the only harm was emotional distress.

The case concerned Jane Cummings, a Texas woman who is deaf and communicates primarily in American Sign Language. In 2016, she sought treatment for chronic back pain at Premier Rehab Keller, a physical therapy facility in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, asking it to provide a sign language interpreter at her appointments.

The facility refused, saying Ms. Cummings could communicate with her therapist using notes, lip reading or gestures. She sued under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Affordable Care Act, both of which ban facilities receiving federal funds — as Premier Rehab Keller had — from discriminating on the basis of disability.

A federal judge found that the only injuries Ms. Cummings had suffered were “humiliation, frustration and emotional distress” and ruled that the laws she invoked did not allow suits for such emotional harm. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, affirmed that ruling.

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., writing for the majority on Thursday, said the laws at issue are something like contracts: In exchange for federal money, businesses agree not to discriminate and to be held accountable if they do. This was also true, he wrote, of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination based on race or national origin, and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which bars discrimination based on sex.

People suing for breach of contract, Chief Justice Roberts continued, generally cannot recover damages for emotional harm caused by the breach. By analogy, he wrote, people suing businesses that accept federal money cannot win such damages, either.

“After all,” the chief justice wrote, “when considering whether to accept federal funds, a prospective recipient would surely wonder not only what rules it must follow, but also what sort of penalties might be on the table.”

The Supreme Court used similar reasoning in 2002 in Barnes v. Gorman, ruling that such federal laws did not allow suits for punitive damages because those kinds of damages were not typically available in lawsuits for breach of contract.

Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr., Neil M. Gorsuch, Brett M. Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett joined the majority opinion.


In dissent, Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote that the chief justice had asked the right question but given the wrong answer. Some sorts of contracts, he wrote, can give rise to suits for emotional harm.


vering the court.


“Does breach of a promise not to discriminate fall into this category?” he wrote. “I should think so.”

“The statutes before us seek to eradicate invidious discrimination,” he wrote. “That purpose is clearly nonpecuniary. And discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex, age or disability is particularly likely to cause serious emotional harm.”

Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan joined Justice Breyer’s dissent in the case, Cummings v. Premier Rehab Keller, No. 20-219.

Quoting an earlier opinion, Justice Breyer added that the majority had lost sight of the larger purpose of the anti-discrimination laws, which was “to vindicate ‘human dignity and not mere economics.’”

“But the court’s decision today allows victims of discrimination to recover damages only if they can prove that they have suffered economic harm, even though the primary harm inflicted by discrimination is rarely economic,” Justice Breyer wrote. “Indeed, victims of intentional discrimination may sometimes suffer profound emotional injury without any attendant pecuniary harms. The court’s decision today will leave those victims with no remedy at all.”",1

That’s the job description.  
Texas just passed a law limiting abortions to 8 weeks. But even upholding those laws should realistically only just amend the 24 week limit set down by Roe to a new standard. If Alito really wanted to overturn Roe he should have waited for the new Louisiana law to come before the court, which essentially bans abortion immediately after conception, and classifies all abortion as homicide. Instead Alito went ahead and wrote an opinion which seems to point to reasons why all abortion should be illegal… then says it should be left up to the individual states.

&gt;*Trump officials “collaborated” with the meatpacking industry to downplay the threat of Covid to plant workers and block public health measures which could have saved lives, a damning new investigation has found.*

The __freight train of one term impeached former President Trump’s treachery__ still lingers, even after his failed __insurrection and miserably conniving__ attempts at *maintaining a stronghold on the RNC, GOP and the USA.

&gt;*Internal documents reviewed by the congressional select subcommittee on the coronavirus crisis reveal how industry representatives lobbied government officials to stifle “pesky” health departments from imposing evidence- based safety measures to curtail the virus spreading - and tried to obscure worker deaths from these authorities.*

Does it really surprise any one of us that his administration lied - about everything basically?

&gt;*At least 59,000 workers at five of the largest meatpacking companies – Tyson Foods, JBS USA Holdings, Smithfield Foods, Cargill and National Beef Packing Company which are the subject of the congressional inquiry – contracted Covid in the first year of the pandemic, of whom at least 269 died.*

Just why would someone do this? Was the idea of profits or perhaps bribes from this industry and enough to put lives in danger.

&gt;*According to internal communications, the companies were warned about workers and their families falling sick within weeks of the virus hitting the US. Despite this, company representatives enlisted industry - 
friendly Trump appointees at the USDA to fight their battles against Covid regulations and oversight. In addition, company executives intentionally stoked fears about meat shortages in order to justify continuing to operate the plants under dangerous conditions.*

When will people say enough is enough.

&gt;*Trump’s political appointees at USDA collaborated with large meatpacking companies to lead an administration-wide effort to force workers to remain on the job during the coronavirus crisis despite dangerous conditions, and even to prevent the imposition of commonsense mitigation measures. This coordinated campaign prioritized industry production over the health of workers and communities, and contributed to tens of thousands of workers becoming ill, hundreds of workers dying, and the virus spreading throughout surrounding areas.*

The Republican Party supports fraud, fear, fascism, racism, hatred, bribes, autocracy  and the __pursuit of alternative facts (lies).__

And grifting.

&gt;*The report, Now to get rid of those pesky healthy departments!, reveals how USDA Trump appointees did the industry’s bidding in order to carry on with business as usual.*

Imagine how *different* the world would be right now if one term twice impeached former President Trump had __never entered the Republican presidential election process?__

&gt;*Donald Trump considered quitting his first run for the presidency after the notorious recording about him grabbing women surfaced a month before the election...*

I remember when these tapes surfaced. I thought to myself - there's no way that this man will win the Republican nomination for the presidency.

&gt;*The videotape of a chat with “Access Hollywood” host Billy Bush in 2005 captured Trump boasting that he could get away with anything with women because he was the star of the “Apprentice” reality TV series. “I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait,” Trump said on tape. “When you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab ’em by the pussy. You can do anything.”*

There's no way that they would let someone like this in the White House.

__Boy was I wrong.__

And look at the mess that one term twice impeached former President Trump left behind. There is so much that we have to fix from his disastrous presidency. But we will.


We have the __right man, for the right job, at the right time.__

One step at a time.

Since he has been in office? President Biden's accomplishments are many. Some of the __most important issues__ that President Biden has been working on is:

■ __Aid Packages.__ Devising and implementing numerous aid packages for the USA.

&gt;*Biden signed a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package in March 2021 that included up to $1,400 per person to financially struggling Americans, extended unemployment support and provided billions of dollars to help schools, colleges and universities reopen.*

■ __Affordable Care Act (ACA).__ Revitalizing the ACA so that everyone has access to affordable health care. One term twice impeached former President Trump  tried to __destroy the ACA every which way he could.__ One of the main ways that he tried to destroy it was to allow unscrupulous insurance companies that __charge money for policies that actually cover nothing.__ And the only way people knew they covered nothing was when they tried to use them, especially during an emergency. Trump allowed his cronies and wealthy insurance executive friends to sell meaningless policies. Which, IMO, is another way that he made it clear that he did not care about us. And it's sad.

&gt;*Biden expanded access to affordable health care for five million Americans.*

■ __Executive Orders.__ Revoking many executive orders prepared by one term twice impeached former President Trump that were just devastatingly destructive in so many ways to the United States. It is President Biden's job to __enact laws to protect and be all inclusive of everyone in the USA.__  One term twice impeached former President Trump constantly __enacted executive orders__ that did not do that. If you read over the executive orders that were enacted on President Biden's first day in office? __None of them__ have the flavor of someone who wants to be a dictator. 

Executive Orders 

__President Joseph Biden__

Total - 89

12 - 2022

77 - 2021

■ __Jobless Claims.__ The amount of people in the USA submitting jonless claims has actually decreased.

&gt;*Jobless claims are the lowest since 1969.*

■ __Job Creation.__ Under President Biden? Jobs are bring created.

&gt;*6,000,000 jobs have been created already.*

■ __Repairing Relationships with Allies.__ Repairing our relationships with our allies is very important during a war. Unlike one term twice impeached former President Trump? Predident Biden is __highly respected by our European allies.__ He has coordinated a well structured plan to counterattack Putins horrific assault on Ukraine, while keeping World War III away from America's shores.

■ __Supporting Science (not Pseudo Science).__

&gt;*The United States under Joe Biden is no longer denying science, but is once again a respected global leader in world affairs. We are doing our part to champion the health of our planet.*

■ __Uemployment.__ unemployment has actually improved under President Biden.

&gt;*Under Joe Biden, unemployment dropped to 3.9%; under Donald Trump, unemployment was 6.3%.*

■ __Vaccinations.__ 

&gt;*Biden put in place a $20 billion vaccination program to fight COVID. While 1% of the U.S. population was vaccinated when Biden came into office, 74% of Americans - 249 million Americans - have received at least one vaccine dose.*

■ __Working on Debt.__ President Biden __incurred trillions__ (yes - trillions) in debt because of one term twice impeached former President Trump’s actions.

&gt;*Republican candidate Donald Trump promised during the 2016 presidential campaign that he would eliminate the nation’s debt in eight years. Instead, his budget estimates showed that he would actually add at least $8.3 trillion, increasing the U.S. debt to $28.5 trillion by 2025. But the national debt reached that figure much sooner. The national debt stood at $19.9 trillion when President Trump took office in January 2017, and it reached a high of $27 trillion in October 2020.*

First off, you linked a blog post. Second off, the original article that it's responding to doesn't refute what I said at all. In fact, it seems to do more to prove it. The nurse was whining on Facebook about having to give a prescription she didn't like to a student and then complained about 12 non-binary people existing. They were not forcing either the blockers nor the labels of non-binary, merely giving the prescription that the kid's doctor wrote for them and using they/them pronouns for the kids who asked for that.

The grooming is done by social actions taken in schools to convince and coerce children into believing and accepting these things and awarded through community support for going along with it.

Okay so you’re a typical edgy conservative who doesn’t know what grooming is. Grooming specifically means when a predator is preparing a child for some kind of encounter that will involve a sexual offense. Schools saying that being trans is okay is not grooming.

&gt; Books such as gender queer are not appropriate for grade schoolers.

Why not? It’s an autobiography about someone describing their experiences as a queer person.

&gt; Giving puberty blockers and affirming gender identities without parental knowledge or consent is not what public schools are for.

Schools don’t give out puberty blockers willy-nilly. That’s not a thing that happens. If a doctor prescribes them after a conversation has been had between the person and their doctor, then the schools will sometimes have the prescription with them just like any other prescription in the world.

When it comes to the affirming gender identities, a school’s primary objective is to create a safe learning environment. If that involves changing the word you say while referring to someone, it’s a small change with no detriment to the staff or students but can have a lot of benefits for someone who is queer.",1

Some would vote for one democrat and some for the other, meaning each candidate has less votes in total. That means without having to convince any swing voters, the Republican wins hands down. This problem gets worse and worse the more people are on the ballot with someone who represents an increasingly smaller part of the population getting elected with more candidates.

5806,"I would say the comparison to the electoral college and number of representatives is more parallel than directly reliant on each other.  The constitution says each state gets at least 1 representative and then the remainder based on population. 1 representative can represent no more than 30k people so that is where districts are created. Congress has capped the total number of representatives so instead of just adding more for population growth, there is a jockeying on who gets or loses seats. ([https://www.visitthecapitol.gov/sites/default/files/documents/resources-and-activities/CVC\_HS\_ActivitySheets\_CongApportionment.pdf](https://www.visitthecapitol.gov/sites/default/files/documents/resources-and-activities/CVC_HS_ActivitySheets_CongApportionment.pdf))  


 The Electoral college is a completely different slate of electors that are chosen by the party that won the popular vote. TECHNICALLY we dont directly vote for the president. Instead we vote for the party and then the party leads meet and vote for their candidate. The number of EC members is directly related to the number of reps and senators but they are not the same members. It is normally used as a brownie point for good, up and coming political members. I bet if you donated enough to a PAC you could demand to be on the EC for your state if you swing your money around. (https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/allocation)  


That being said, the EC is why we have had a lot of weird discussions on the presidential race in the last 6 years. There are possibilities that electors can vote against their party if they felt so inclined. These are called faithless electors and there were a few who refused to vote for trump in 2016. Some states have laws in place that fine faithless electors and replace them, making the whole thing moot. Of course we are now dealing with the fact that an intentional scheme of overturning the election was put in place by pushing for a false slate of electors and thus causing chaos in the certification of their votes. Something that was seen as a traditional form has now become a battleground of political bullshittery. This could honestly lead to a whole other can of worms of every election having multiple electors from each party just to cause chaos which is bad for our democracy.

The Presidential Records Act (PRA) was developed after Watergate scandal. It requires that the administrations of all presidents document and maintain records of the White House decisionmaking process.


&gt;The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) retrieved multiple White House record boxes last month that were improperly kept at former President Trump's Mar-a-Lago property, The Washington Post reported. The boxes reportedly contained important records of communication, gifts and letters from world leaders, which, according to the Post, is a violation of the Presidential Records Act. The newspaper added that the boxes retrieved from the Florida estate included correspondence with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as well as a letter from former President Obama to Trump.



Why is this is this type of behavior encouraged, ignored or cheered on by his constituents?


&gt;Presidential records and federal records belong to the United States government. Only personal records can be taken and retained after leaving government service.  Under the Presidential Records Act (PRA), these are (1) materials relating exclusively to the President’s own election and to the election of a particular individual or individuals to federal, state, or local office that “have no relation to or direct effect upon the carrying out of constitutional, statutory, or other official or ceremonial duties of the President;” and (2) materials relating to private political associations.  44 U.S.C. §2201.  


The January 6 Committee is __finally getting a hold__ of the documents and data that former President Trump tried to keep away from the eyes of America and the world.



He took it all the way to the Supreme Court and caused delays in the investigatory process. This is something he is very well known for.

Constant delay tactics.


&gt;The panel began receiving the records it had requested from the National Archives, and will continue to do in the coming weeks and months. That’s obviously good news for justice, though in less good news, it turns out that a number of the documents in question will be more difficult to examine than one might have hoped, because Trump apparently had a habit of tearing up official presidential business like a man who knew he’d one day have something to hide.

I had heard that former President Trump would tear documents into tiny pieces and then *chew on them.*

I was __unaware of the fact that he'd actually flush documents__ down the toilet and clog up the pipes at the White House. 

More than once. Like it was a regular occurrence.

&gt;While President Trump was in office, staff in the White House residence periodically discovered wads of printed paper clogging a toilet - and believed the president had flushed pieces of paper, Maggie Haberman scoops in her forthcoming book, “Confidence Man.”

*Imagine that?*

&gt;This detail comes as the National Archive has enlisted the Department of Justice to investigate whether Trump either improperly, or illegally, removed classified documents, or documents with classified information, from the White House, as The New York Times reported Wednesday evening.

So many documents, so many secrets, so many disgusting things we __will never know about.__ 

But that's okay. We already know __quite a bit.__

&gt;Maggie Haberman appeared on CNN’s New Day Thursday morning to discuss the … explosive report staffers in the Trump White House revealed to her that, periodically, engineers (plumbers?) had to unclog pipes after paper documents had been flushed down the toilet.



The __snowball of criminal activity__ and abhorrent behavior is running down hill, gaining momentum and collecting debris (re: discoveries of prior criminal activity, current  onslaught of new criminal activity, and his minions, of course) along the way. 


Far surpassing __anything__ any one of us could ever have imagined.

Former President Trump __won't be able to stop it.__

6132,"Just read this book called Peril which goes over the end of Trump and start of Biden. Really well researched and basically 100% direct quotes from people describing conversations. That's my only source on this. 

In that book they have him in the oval office basically going ""well shit, how did this happen"" and Pence, McConnell and Graham telling him he should have stuck to his policies and stayed off Twitter. Given his grievances less air, rather than letting them define him. He is a narcissist and told his base what they needed to hear to get him the attention and praise he wanted. He acknowledged that they are bad people but the fact they loved him was more important to him than actual morality. I know publicly he was saying one thing to his base, but according this book at least he was saying something else privately.

The book said that Graham was still pursuing Trump as the best chance they have for 2022. That's the focus. Coaching Trump to leave the grievances behind and focus on the policies which were popular for them. Now I think Trump is a very dangerous person to give any power (even the power to give out parking fines), but I also don't like those policies. So I'm wary of him when he's playing the game and keeping his nose clean. Easy to brush him off as a has been while he's acting the clown.

6324,"Geopolitics are complex and their true goal can only be understood decades later. All the ""experts"" cite a million reasons, but omit the main one: world order. Russia and China are challenging the post-Cold War world order established by the US and allies.

I'm not going to give my opinion on whether what the US did with that acquired power is good or bad, but I know that strategically they missed the opportunity to bring in Russia as an ally when the latter was willing to do so in the early 2000s with Putin at the realm. That would have helped massively in further geopolitical developments, and countering China's challenge would be much easier today.

But that's water under the bridg. Today, what Putin will do no one knows for sure, those who do will never share the info with the public because it is also a messaging war. What's Putin's plan? No idea, but I assume it is all a continuous front that will not cease just with a de-escalation in Ukraine. The end goal is adding 2 more seats at the big table. Of course the US will not capitulate, but can this world order defiance by Russia and China be stopped in the long term? I seriously don't know, it's not as easy as in the 80s with the fall of the Soviet Union. But sooner or later this will have a resolution and we will either live in a multipolar world from a geopolitics point of view, the West will collapse.. or there'll be WWIII.

Before 2014 Putin had no interest in retaking Crimea before the US's involvement in overthrowing Ukraine's democratically elected leader ​Yanukovych in a coup. Our actions are directly responsible for Putin's renewed interests in Crimea. 

If you are trying to understand why, consider the analogy of Russia forming a military alliance with Mexico and Canada and leaving the US out. This is what we have been doing with Ukraine, a territory that has a longer history with Russia than US has been a country and has even been a part of Russia (many Ukrainians consider themselves Russian). 

Can you imagine the American outrage if this was done to us in reverse? Russia is in no position to take over all of Europe, and they don't want to. They are just trying to remain afloat. The west has been antagonizing them since the Cold War and since nobody seems to follow what is going on globally, we don't realize it. It only appears that Putin is reacting

First, you could claim that anyone who commits a crime and sites QAnon as their inspiration was actually involved in a conspiracy to commit that crime with Q, meaning Q would be liable for the crime as well. But this would be difficult to prove since Q never explicitly instructed that person to do that act.

Second, you could go the route of Stochastic Terrorism, claiming that Q intended to incite violence or the commission of a crime. But as we've seen with the mafia in the past, Stochastic Terrorism is stupidly difficult to prove and the first amendment gives robust protections.

Third, you could charge Q with terroristic threats, but again, it's be hard to prove that what they were advocating for was actually meant to invoke violence or crimes.

Fourth, you could argue that Q committed sedition by advocating people oppose the government by force. Sedition is famously difficult to prove however, especially if you can't directly link the person who advocated for it to a specific action.

Finally, probably the easiest one, you could charge Q with defamation, claiming that their statements were false and malicious and caused damage to a person's reputation or business.

When the leadership of the Republican party decided to post a meme / graphic to celebrate USA presidents and to only mention Republican presidents of the USA?

I think that's abhorrent. It must have been the idea of pugnacious demagogue and want-to-be fascist dictator / defeated one term President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice).__ because he loves to so hate and celebrate dividing our country. In fact? He's the one that lead an insurrection.

&gt;It's unclear why the RNC chose those specific presidents. It’s not simply a reverse-order list of the most recent Republicans in the Oval Office, as it skips Gerald Ford and Herbert Hoover. It’s also not a list of the most popular GOP presidents, as it omits Theodore Roosevelt, who consistently ranks near the top of polls and surveys.

To top it off? They listed President Nixon and did not list President Roosevelt. And of course they listed their insurrectionist leader. If you note the opinions of entities that track such things? He's always listed as among the worst Presidents in the USA.

Perhaps that's why they listed President Nixon? After all? If you're going to list impeached presidents as great presidential leaders? You might as well list one who resigned before being impeached and one who was impeached twice.

&gt;Only three U.S. presidents have been formally impeached by Congress - Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton and Donald Trump. One of those presidents, Donald Trump, was impeached twice during his single term. No U.S. president has ever been removed from office through impeachment.

What? Is impeachment a badge of honor?

IMO? It truly shows that the interests of the Republican party continue to lean toward dividing our country.

&gt;The official GOP account tweeted a meme mocking President Joe Biden while celebrating Richard M. Nixon and Donald Trump, among others ...

Shame.

&gt;Over and over again this week - as Russia massed forces along Ukraine's borders and then invaded on Wednesday night - the former US President found time to praise Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Once again praising Putins, an immoral and reprehensible autocratic, former President Trump should not be partijtagiong on the world stage at the moment. __No other former president__ has said one word.

&gt;""I went in yesterday and there was a television screen, and I said, 'This is genius.' Putin declares a big portion of the Ukraine — of Ukraine. Putin declares it as  independent,"" Trump said. ""Oh, that's wonderful."" Later in that same interview, Trump said this: ""Putin is now saying, 'It's independent,' a large section of Ukraine. I said, 'How smart is that?' And he's gonna go in and be a peacekeeper.""

Former President Trump is not helping anyone or anything.

&gt;Trump's attraction to authoritarian rulers then is well established. He likes the idea that they do what they want when they want -- and damn the naysayers who question them. Given all of that, no one should be surprised that Trump is praising Putin, even as the Russian President provokes conflict in Europe. It's what Trump seems to believe. Which is pretty scary.

For the most part?

We know impeached former President Trump's stance on numerous issues.

All you have to do is read his executive orders and you can get the tone pretty quickly.

&gt;An executive order is declaration by the president or a governor which has the force of law, usually based on existing statutory powers. They do not require any action by the Congress or state legislature to take effect, and the legislature cannot overturn them.  For example, in anticipation of the Gulf War, President George H. Bush signed Executive Order 12724, which prohibited transactions with Iraq and summarily transferred ownership of Iraqi government property in the United States to the United States government. The executive order was issued pursuant to Congressional statutes, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the National Emergencies Act.

During President Biden's first days (starting 01-20-2021) in office? He had to revoke many of the executive orders of impeached former President Trump.

Mitt Romney, R-Utah, after her latest social media video promoted a debunked theory about biolabs in Ukraine.

I think the videos she __posted say it all.__

&gt;In the video, which was posted to Gabbard's TikTok and other social media accounts, the former congresswoman mischaracterized U.S. support for several dozen former Soviet biolabs in Ukraine, falsely implying that the labs work with diseases like COVID-19 and that the Biden administration had been ""trying to cover this up.""

Our post after another of hers.

&gt;The claim is a variation on a Russian disinformation allegation about U.S. support for the labs that dates back to at least 2014, according to EUvsDisinfo, a watchdog group that advises the European Union and its members on disinformation.

I pray Russia stops its genocide.

&gt;Defense officials have observed that the claim may be a pretext for Russian leader Vladimir Putin to increase attacks on civilian populations in Ukraine, even potentially unleashing his own biological or chemical weapons.

And that people who support Russia in any way, shape or form keep their mouths shut. Or move to Russia.

Also, as a general piece of advice, when you do your debating you should act in good faith, because many of your points you created against me are strawman positions I do not hold.

Based on the information I'm reading and hearing from Tulsi, her position is we should DESTROY the pathogens in these labs for the safety of the world, not that their is a joint venture to create bioweapons between the U.S. and Ukraine which appears to be a Russia and Chinese misinformation campaign.

I decided to do some more research on this and Tulsi a person who's opinion I generally respect even when I don't always agree with.  So I did some research and here's what I found.

Her claims are there are 25-30 BIOLABS that are funded by the U.S., not Biological weapons labs which is apparently what Russia and China are claiming.  Source:

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5YfIOtJw6f0

There doesn't seem to be a ton of easily accessible information on the number of BIOLABS in Ukraine but I did find this article from 2020 that specifically mentions a U.S. and Ukrainian partnership under the title of the ""Biological Threat Protection Program"" that's designed to ""counter the threat of outbreaks (deliberate, accidental, or natural) of the world’s most dangerous infectious diseases. ""

Furthermore the website mentions:

""The Biological Threat Reduction Program’s priorities in Ukraine are to consolidate and secure pathogens and toxins of security concern""

Source:

https://ua.usembassy.gov/embassy/kyiv/sections-offices/defense-threat-reduction-office/biological-threat-reduction-program/

Based on my limited research I've not been able to confirm the 25-30 BIOLABS but the website does mention this:

""BTRP has upgraded many laboratories for the Ministry of Health and the State Food Safety and Consumer Protection Service of Ukraine, reaching Biosafety Level 2. In 2019, BTRP constructed two laboratories for the latter, one in Kyiv and one in Odesa.""

So they constructed at least 2 labs and upgraded ""many"" (more).

You said:

&gt;I'm not saying she's right or wrong but have her claims been thoroughly debunked?  Also how would her spreading incorrect information (at best) or lies (at worst) about bio labs in Ukraine benefit Russia?

Because it's basically a __boilerplate of what Russia is telling everyone else.__ Including their own people and the UN. So if you agree with what Russia is saying?

You are *supporting* their narrative.

&gt;He claimed his goal was to protect people subjected to bullying and genocide and aim for the ""demilitarisation and de-Nazification"" of Ukraine. There has been no genocide in Ukraine: it is a vibrant democracy, led by a president who is Jewish.

All statements are fallacies. Not true. 

And? You're basically agreeing with reasons Russia gave (__way after the war started__ - late in the game) for deciding to destroy Ukraine.

&gt;Both the US and Ukraine have categorically denied that they are developing any biological weapons inside the country. At Friday’s meeting, the US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said: “I will say this once: ‘Ukraine does not have a biological weapons program.’” She went on to turn the accusation back on Moscow. “It is Russia that has long maintained a biological weapon program in violation of international law.”

She is referring to the fact that, even though Russia has __signed many documents saying that they would not use__ biochemical warfare or agents? They have been doing it. Against their __own citizens.__ Over and over again.

&gt;The United Nations has said it is not aware of a biological weapons programme in Ukraine, as Russia’s claim that such a programme exists was rejected by Washington and its allies at an emergency Security Council meeting.

Again? Remember - Russia has a __history of using biochemical agents to kill or hurt people__ they feel threatened by.

Like other supporters of autocracy, dictators, or want to be dictators? Putin has a __tendency to accuse__ other people of doing exactly what he is doing.

Ukraine __has not used__ biochemical warfare or agents against anyone.

&gt;Soviet defectors who worked on the programme, such as Ken Alibek (formerly Kanatjan Alibekov), have also confirmed that it had been developing these weapons on a considerable scale and that they could kill 100,000 people in a strike.

Most recently? Putin seems to like to use chemical warfare against his own people. Especially people that do not agree with his ideologies.

&gt;Russia used Novichok nerve agent – a type of chemical weapon – in the attempted assassinations of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018 and Alexei Navalny in 2020, although Russia denies this. These incidents took place after Russia claimed to have eliminated its chemical arms. The attacks demonstrate that Russia has both the resources to carry out chemical warfare and the willingness to do so.

Also? The UN, NATO, the USA, and most other countries in the world state that this is not true.

Except perhaps? Putin supporters.

An interesting tidbit of news to think about?

When the __Russian backed Syrian government__ was carrying out a similar type of war? They accused others of using chemical warfare. But when it came right down to it? Syrian leader, backed by Russia, Bashar al-Assad, ordered the use of chemical agents that killed their fellow countrymen. And they were encouraged to do so by Russia.

I remember the __bodies of human beings strewn along the street due to chemical warfare agents__ being used on them. It was abhorrent. And denied. But it was al-Assads way to squash any type of rebellion or any type of conclusive way of banding together against him.

&gt;Prime Minister Boris Johnson described the strategy as ""straight out of their playbook"", as it is the same one Russian-backed Bashar al-Assad used for carrying out chemical attacks during the civil war in Syria.

&gt;Russia has a track record of accusing the West of the very crimes that Russia itself is perpetrating.""

What does happen to be true? Every time Russia accuses someone else of doing something? It is because they are doing it or about to do it. This has happened time and time again.

&gt;And by the end of the invasion’s second week - with Putin’s indiscriminate bombardment of civilian targets intensifying, and the death toll mounting rapidly; with more than two and a half million Ukrainians having fled the country, and millions more under relentless attack in besieged cities and towns; and with no end in sight—Zelensky no longer deferred to outside experts to describe what Ukrainians face in the most absolute terms. “I will appeal directly to the nations of the world if the leaders of the world do not make every effort to stop this war,” he said in a video message on Tuesday. He paused, and looking directly into the camera, added, “This genocide.""

7007,"Because it's basically a __boilerplate of what Russia is telling everyone else.__ Including their own people and the UN. So if you agree with what Russia is saying?

You are *supporting* their narrative.

&gt;He claimed his goal was to protect people subjected to bullying and genocide and aim for the ""demilitarisation and de-Nazification"" of Ukraine. There has been no genocide in Ukraine: it is a vibrant democracy, led by a president who is Jewish.

All statements are fallacies. Not true. 

And? You're basically agreeing with reasons Russia gave (__way after the war started__ - late in the game) for deciding to destroy Ukraine.

&gt;Both the US and Ukraine have categorically denied that they are developing any biological weapons inside the country. At Friday’s meeting, the US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said: “I will say this once: ‘Ukraine does not have a biological weapons program.’” She went on to turn the accusation back on Moscow. “It is Russia that has long maintained a biological weapon program in violation of international law.”

She is referring to the fact that, even though Russia has __signed many documents saying that they would not use__ biochemical warfare or agents? They have been doing it. Against their __own citizens.__ Over and over again.

&gt;The United Nations has said it is not aware of a biological weapons programme in Ukraine, as Russia’s claim that such a programme exists was rejected by Washington and its allies at an emergency Security Council meeting.

Again? Remember - Russia has a __history of using biochemical agents to kill or hurt people__ they feel threatened by.

Like other supporters of autocracy, dictators, or want to be dictators? Putin has a __tendency to accuse__ other people of doing exactly what he is doing.

Ukraine __has not used__ biochemical warfare or agents against anyone.

&gt;Soviet defectors who worked on the programme, such as Ken Alibek (formerly Kanatjan Alibekov), have also confirmed that it had been developing these weapons on a considerable scale and that they could kill 100,000 people in a strike.

Most recently? Putin seems to like to use chemical warfare against his own people. Especially people that do not agree with his ideologies.

&gt;Russia used Novichok nerve agent – a type of chemical weapon – in the attempted assassinations of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018 and Alexei Navalny in 2020, although Russia denies this. These incidents took place after Russia claimed to have eliminated its chemical arms.

Traitorous. Russia also said the Luger center in Georgia was making zombies. Tulsi should go to Russia,” Kinzinger wrote in a retweet of the video Gabbard published earlier that day. Gabbard tweeted a nearly two-minute video on Sunday laying out “the undeniable fact” that the U.S. funds between 25 and 30 biolabs in Ukraine that are “conducting research on dangerous pathogens.”

Undeniable facts are strong words to use. Especially when what you actually mean to say is alternative facts.

And we all know what alternative facts are? They are giving you permission to lie.

In the text, which has not been previously reported, Donald Trump Jr. lays out ideas for keeping his father in power by subverting the Electoral College process, according to the message reviewed by CNN. The text is among records obtained by the House select committee investigating January 6, 2021. ""It's very simple,"" Trump Jr. texted to Meadows on November 5, adding later in the same missive: ""We have multiple paths We control them all.""*

And we know they think they are infallible.

■ Lady Liberty

■ our democracy

■ the rule of law

■ the strength of our Nation

Unless?

__We do nothing.__ Which would allow seeds of hatred and the ideology of impeached former President Trump and his minions / supporters to continue to grow.

&gt;*The November 5 text message outlines a strategy that is nearly identical to what allies of the former President attempted to carry out in the months that followed. Trump Jr. makes specific reference to filing lawsuits and advocating recounts to prevent certain swing states from certifying their results, as well as having a handful of Republican state houses put forward slates of fake ""Trump electors."" If all that failed, according to the Trump Jr. text, GOP lawmakers in Congress could simply vote to reinstall Trump as President on January 6.*

Wow.  So way back in November 2020 there is evidence that they were planning a coup. Probably even before that as the investigation goes further.

__Complacency leads to compliance.__

Luckily the two terrorists were killed (by a 'good guy with a gun'), so the FBI wouldn't have to face the embarrassment of two mass shooters getting off scot free.

Just imagine if Democrats had taken everyone's guns, then maybe the FBI could have pulled off a more successful mass shooting, without an armed citizen stopping it. And don't worry, the terrorists would have had guns, because they got them from the FBI through the Fast &amp; Furious gun running scandal.

They convinced a couple muslim guys to go shoot up the event (one, coincidentally, had a gun from the Fast &amp; Furious gun running scheme.. so the government literally giving guns to terrorists to go shoot Americans...). Then they drove with them to the event, and sat taking photos while they opened fire. Luckily some random guy with a gun (it's Texas, afterall) shot the two guys dead. 

But imagine if that guy hadn't been there, and the FBI literally just let a mass shooting happen. Hilariously, the FBI also provided consultation for security on that event.

Mike Rounds on Sunday made it clear that he didn’t subscribe to Trump’s conspiracy theories about the 2020 election being stolen from him. “As a part of our due diligence, we looked at over 60 different accusations made in multiple states,” the South Dakota Republican said on ABC’s “This Week.“ “While there were some irregularities, there were none of the irregularities which would have risen to the point where they would have changed the vote outcome in a single state.“

Progressives know that we probably needed double if not more to really fix all the infrastructure in the US. We got a win but it doesn't feel like a win because we can see how it can be better.

Whether it's red or blue or whatever? 


That's a great thing about America - you get to vote for who you want. 



However? Unfortunately? 



Because of new laws being implemented?


&gt;More than 400 bills with provisions that restrict voting access have been introduced in 49 states in the 2021 legislative sessions.


Your vote may actually mean nothing. 


Because some board can decide that your vote was a mistake / error and overturn your vote. 



And then the person that was not actually elected? 


They win the election. 



Kind of what the last Administration tried to do with their defeated candidate. 

Have him elected, even though he did not actually win.



&gt;This wave of restrictions on voting — the most aggressive we have seen in more than a decade of tracking state voting laws — is in large part motivated by false and often racist allegations about voter fraud.


It's actually happening right now all over America. 



&gt;Twenty-four new laws will “politicize, criminalize, and interfere in election administration.”


&gt;Republicans are rushing to change the rules to make it easier for their party to overturn the will of the voters in future elections. 

In this manner? They will be insured to have __only Republicans take office.__


&gt;While GOP-controlled legislatures rush to make it harder for Democratic constituencies to vote, they are also intensifying their control over how elections are run and how votes are counted, after Trump tried to overturn the 2020 election results. Twenty-four new laws have been passed in 14 states this year that will allow state legislatures to “politicize, criminalize, and interfere in election administration,” according to a report released Thursday by three voting rights groups, States United Democracy Center, Law Forward, and Protect Democracy. Overall, 216 bills have been introduced in 41 states to achieve these ends. 



If someone disagrees with election results? They can have the election results thrown out.


And replace it with their candidate, who was clearly defeated.


&gt;Other GOP-controlled states have already changed their laws to make it easier to void election results. As part of its sweeping voter suppression law, Georgia’s heavily gerrymandered legislature removed Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger as the chair and a voting member of the state election board after he rebuffed Trump’s attempt to overturn Joe Biden’s victory. The legislature will now appoint a majority of board members, and the board, in turn, can take over up to four county election boards it deems “underperforming” - raising the prospect that Republicans could assume control of election operations in heavily Democratic areas like Atlanta’s Fulton County.









Imagine that? 

The temerity of pugnacious want-to-be dictator and defeated one term President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__ who is obviously guilty of supreme direlection of duty?

His friends and minions came together and decided to actually change laws so __that he can win elections__ even though people did not vote for him. 


All he has to do is get someone to overturn the results of elections.

&gt;These moves include measures to prevent governors or secretaries of state from modifying election laws or procedures without legislative approval, even in an emergency situation like a pandemic or natural disaster. Some of these efforts are nakedly partisan: In Arizona, where the state Senate has authorized a sham “audit” of 2.1 million ballots in Maricopa County designed to weaponize Trump’s Big Lie about fraud in 2020, a House committee recently passed a provision preventing the Democratic secretary of state from defending state election laws and transferring that power to Arizona’s Republican attorney general—but only through the 2022 election, in case the partisan composition of the offices is reversed after that. Meanwhile, Republicans in states like Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Michigan are attempting to replicate Arizona’s discredited audit.  
 


Imagine that? 


They passed a law giving a lot of power to the governor? 


However?  It's only good until the end of the term of this Republican Governor.


Just in case the next governor was a Democrat. 


If this law is supposed to be such a great thing for all of the voters?

7204,Yeah because you’re the main character in everyone’s story.,1
7205,"There are a lot of swing voters who vote based on how they feel they've been doing economically. So they might go for the not Biden choice, as long as the individual didn't try to stage a coup.",1
7206,Don't bet on it. DeSantis is smarter than Trump and I'd bed money that the never-Trumpers would jump to vote for DeSantis. He's smarter Trump without the baggage.,1
7207,Earnings so far have been pretty damn high. Even retail appears to be up. The stock market under Trump also had the benefit of easy money as well as a tax cut which let them buy back stock to inflate asset prices.,1
7208,"Trump and DeSantis are too much alike, I doubt people would pick him over Biden. Unless people stay home and don't vote then its a possibility.",1
7209,"Compared to Trump. 

Why, because they want you to get vaccinated?

Get the fuck out of here!",1
7210,I think you should actually learn about the nazis before you start throwing that word around. Everything our current admin is trying to do screams 1940's Germany.,1
7211,"&gt;We were supposed to prevent the entire country from ever falling back into the hands of the Taliban.

Yeah, well, any hope of that ended when Trump negotiated with the Taliban for the withdrawal and didn't include the Afghan government.",1

7234,"As far as I am aware there is no one on the record accusing him of anything. There was a phone call his ex-gf was on with an apparent witness, they are leveraging the girlfriend by saying she obstructed justice to testify against Gaetz. 

Fundamentally what might end up happening in a prosecution of Gaetz an obstruction charge in a crime he is never charged with. If that’s the case I’m calling bullshit on this whole thing, the FBI is not an organization I trust through and through. 

If they actually put a face to an accuser and charge him with a crime there then he’ll have his day and court. Under those circumstances I may very well stand corrected. 

We’ll see what happens.",1

7248,never gonna happen,1
7249,"Yep. Statistically speaking, it should be happening here within the next 5 elections.",1
7250,Zero chance of ending the filibuster. Zero. Biden is just virtue signaling and getting hopes up needlessly.,1
7251,Good luck with that,1
7252,This guy seems like a monster,1
7253,"Honestly, best method is to get out the vote is to mail the voters all the forms they need to vote from home.",1
7254,About fucking time,1
7255,I’d tune in for this assholes perp walk.,1
7256,When do people seek immunity? Only in knowledge of a crime or just good general practice?,1
7257,"Sadly no. For reasons I’ve never understood, democrats are not really allowed to use the filibuster",1
7258,"And if there was even the remotest snowballs chance in Hell of any of that happening, that would mean something",1
7259,"But that's not true, they didn't nuke the filibuster that last two times they've been in control, they could have but didn't. Why?",1
7260,Republicans will do whatever they want. When they have power. That's why we need to pass everything now.,1
7261,[removed],1
7262,"Yeah, but that's not something tangible, it isn't something that helps families, or puts food on the table, or helps with healthcare. To say ""vote for us because we'll make sure you can vote for us, even though we're not doing anything to help you out"" isn't a good strategy.",1
7263,"They warned Harry Reid that they'd do that when we nuked the filibuster for lower courts, McConnell said that they would regret doing that when the tables were turned, and here we are. I feel like we don't take their threats seriously and then we get pissed when they actually follow-through....",1
7264,"Yes, I do.

Republicans are outnumbered significantly in popular vote. Gerrymandering maxes out at moving things 2:3, a ratio that democrats are steadily approaching in popular. And the way gerrymandering works, once a region breaks, it largely stays broken. So many states are on the verge of 'permanent blue', and now that the Republicans have done such a good job of killing off their own members, the Dems have a real chance to actually destroy the Republican party this election *if* we get significant voter turnout.",1
7265,One reason to get them out to vote would be they're not blocked from it.,1
7266,They already did with 3 supreme court justices. They go nuclear every time.,1
7267,You really believe that don’t you 😅😂,1
7268,"New maps are in play for the next election, some states have picked up seats that are very likely to go red, the house isn't that big of a majority. I remember people saying in 2010 that there was no way the Republicans were going to take the house, and then they did, and held it for almost a decade.",1
7269,well without voting rights all of that can't happen,1
7270,"It is, but if we don't give people a reason to get out and vote, it's not going to matter how many and who can vote, they're not going to.",1
7271,"He can support it to get points, but knows it won't happen.",1
7272,Well until we do get voting rights legislation passed it’s going to continue like this. We will be ruled by the minority viewpoint and fascism because we can’t seem to act.,1
7273,"Well, ending the filibuster and passing voting rights would be doing something.",1
7274,"I'm with you on that, but unless the Democrats do something soon, the midterms are going to be bad....",1
7275,"Yea, Republicans are already at a point where they're never going to have the House again. Like, *ever*.",1
7276,Then don't let them back in power.,1
7277,Who cares?,1
7278,Agreed,1
7279,"Normally I'd agree with that, but they didn't when they had the majority with Obama, and they didn't with the majority under Trump. I think that they need the filibuster to blame democrats, without it, they don't have that campaign propaganda.",1
7280,I can promise you that when republicans take the house back at the end of this year they are going to whine and cry that democrats are obstructing everything and they themselves will eliminate the filibuster. Frankly it should be done now while democrats have some power to pass some legislation.,1
7281,Or for campaign finance reform or banking reform. It’s like he’s done nothing to restore some of Obama’s policies that Trump undid.,1
7282,I’m pretty confident that when the republicans take back power they are going to blame democrats for obstructing everything and they’re going to eliminate the filibuster themselves.,1
7283,Feel like they’re already at 100% in that department but I’ve been wrong before,1
7284,"Man I feel like this is going bite us hard when the GOP is back in power, they're going to shove everything they can down our throats..",1
7285,Plus side is that housing markets are decidedly less bad in exurbs and rural areas than in cities and adjacent suburbs.,1
7286,or climate change.,1
7287,Or for immigration reform,1
7288,So your boy Biden wants to end filibuster to pass legislation that benefits Democrat politicians. But not a peep out of him to do this for legislation that would benefit tens of millions of Americans - raising the minimum wage. SMH,1
7289,"Fix the wording of Rule 22!  Rather than pile up carve out after carve out on the current rules fix the issue for good by changing the wording of Rule 22 - the rule that defines the voting for cloture and filibuster votes back to ""three-fifths present and voting"" from the current ""three-fifths duly chosen and sworn"".

7293,"Not saying I think the GA voter bill was a good thing, but that’s an odd example to pick of the filibuster being used to support white supremacy, considering the filibuster was not used (GA does not have one), but actually could have been used to prevent the bill if it was. The vote was 32 to 16, with 8 Dems not present. That’s less than the 60% required to shut down a filibuster.",1

7304,Is the filibuster what is stopping Manchin from voting for it? Fingers crossed,1
7305,"Hey... I was trying to have a conversation. All you had to say was: ""Shut up. Vote for a democrat."" Which makes sense, because any talking point you had, evaporated in the first half of this year. I look at policy only. You just listen to what they say. Bad move.

7312,"This just reaffirms the stance I've had for years. Liberal voters in dark red and dark blue areas need to move to purple and pink areas to manually ungerrymander the nation.

There needs to be a concerted ad / education campaign to drive home the message to Democratic and Independent voters. 

**Republicans ALWAYS vote for the Republican no matter how awful the candidate is**

Republicans will always vote for the Republican even if the candidate is garbage, whereas, Democrats will vote 3rd party or just stay home if there is some small aspect of the candidate they don't like.  **The result is that, for Republicans, garbage is a feature, not a bug**. It helps them win elections. So-called""decent"" Republicans will always rationalize voting for the garbage, and the garbage will always attract new voters who normally sit out elections.

Democratic politicians have to walk the line, a line that often so narrow as to be non-existent, in order to have a chance of winning. This has to stop. Liberals / Democrats need to get over themselves because you can safely bet your mother's life Republicans are coming out to vote for the Republican no matter what.  Fight it out in the primary but then vote Democrat. Period.

**The Republican party is fundamentally the party of Trump and Trumpism**

It became the party of Trump because it wins them elections. It will continue to be the party of Trump until it stops winning elections. Only Democrats can make Trumpism fail -- by voting consistently and in large numbers against the Republican.

&gt;Former Attorney General William Barr says he would vote for Donald Trump if he ran for the White House again, even after deeming the former president responsible for the storming of the U.S. Capitol.

Former AG Barr admits he was basically a bad president.

&gt;""He wouldn’t listen to anybody except a little coterie of sycophants who were telling him what he wanted to hear,” Barr said. “I think he did a lot of damage after the election, both with this idea that the election was stolen, and also by him rallying this group to Capitol Hill where the clear purpose was to intimidate the vice president and Congress.”

One of former AG Barrs job was to uphold all elements of the US Constitution. And here he is admitting how much damage impeached former President Trump has done.

Even __after admitting impeached former President Trump caused the insurrection and that he went off the rails in regards to election fraud claims?__ Causing damage to the USA and our US Constitution? He would vote for him over any Democratic nominee. If he was in place as the Republican candidate for the Presidency.

A retired general, amongst many others, believes another insurrection is possible.


&gt;Speaking with CNN host Pamela Brown, one of the three retired generals who contributed to an op-ed for the Washington Post warning of a possible military coup in 2024 if there is a contested presidential election result, slammed supporters of former president Donald Trump for maintaining the belief that the election was stolen. In particular, he singled out anyone who continues to take MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell and his conspiracy theories seriously.


Extremism truly exists in the military.



&gt; According to Ret. Gen Steven M. Anderson, he is serious about his worries about a Trump-inspired military takeover while at the same time admitting that he is a lifelong conservative. ""If you look at the extremism that has gone on within the military, you look at those that were active on the actual assault on the capitol, over 10 percent had a military background,"" Anderson began. ""We all saw the pictures of the guys with the zip ties and helmets and marching formations into that throng. You know, there's a threat within.""

Are there enough members of the military (who __believe in the rule of law)__ to protect our nation and the US Constitution? 


It's worrisome to think that this type of question has come up because of pugnacious want-to-be dictator and former one term President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__ and his minions fighting for an autocratic USA.

Unless we really write laws to protect our US Constitution in the future? There's nothing saying that something like this can't happen again.

&gt;Interrupting the certification of Joe Biden’s election win on 6 January last year as part of the scheme to return Donald Trump to office was known to be unlawful by at least one of the former president’s lawyers, according to an email exchange about the potential conspiracy.

And? You put it in writing?

&gt;The former Trump lawyer John Eastman – who helped coordinate the scheme from the Trump “war room” at the Willard hotel in Washington - conceded in an email to counsel for then vice-president Mike Pence, Greg Jacob, that the plan was a violation of the Electoral Count Act.

But you begged others to help you in the scheme because it was only a minor violation (in your opinion) of the law on?

&gt;But Eastman then urged Pence to move ahead with the scheme anyway, pressuring the former vice-president’s counsel to consider supporting the effort on the basis that it was only a “minor violation” of the statute that governed the certification procedure.

This admission goes directly against the claim that everybody thought they were following the law.

&gt;The admission that the scheme was unlawful undercuts arguments by Eastman and the Willard war room team that they believed there was no wrongdoing in seeking to have Pence delay the certification past 6 January – one of the strategies they sought to return Trump to power.

7981,"I briefly reviewed the article and think both of you are wrong. I'm not a lawyer, but here's what I have:

1st, Shawnee State University is a public institution that receives public funding. Freedom of speech would be allowed here, because public institutions are local governments. Despite this, it doesn't seem to be a speech issue.

2nd, according to the article; the university filed a Title IX complaint (regarding discrimination) against the teacher. That's a boneheaded thing to do, as the Supreme court has already ruled that the government has to be neutral when weighing religious rights even when they are in opposition to gender rights (look up Masterpiece Cake case). The teacher was punished for his sincerely held religious beliefs, and the school used a federal tool to punish him.

3rd, this is a 1st Amendment issue, but not the one you are thinking of. It's more about the free exercise clause of religious freedoms.

4th, this isn't even a freedom of speech case; they are actually trying to force the teacher to speak specific words he doesn't believe, as he offered to not use the objected pronouns. So he wasn't trying to use his speech as a tool, he was refusing to say specific things.

Note, the teacher attempted to accommodate the situation, but it was the student who refused the accommodation. From what I've seen, that step to accommodate the student was not necessary, but a considerate attempt at a compromise.

Finally, I'm atheist and don't agree with this teacher's viewpoints; but he does have rights afforded him in the US Constitution (as currently interpreted) as do we all.",1

The groups' challenge, filed last month with the Georgia secretary of state's office, claims that Greene was involved in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and is therefore ineligible to run for re-election under the 14th Amendment of the Consitution. The 14th Amendment was ratified shortly after the Civil War, and bars lawmakers who supported or engaged in an insurrection from serving again.*

This __case will have far reaching ramifications__ on insurrection participants, many of whom were affiliated with Congress on January 6.

The 14th Amendment __could be a gateway to ensure accountability__ for America.

One by one? Congressional (and other politically connected) coup instigators are being discovered. It's only a matter of time before the 14th Amendment will be utilized again.

&gt;*Outside of the individual case, however, Totenberg's ruling ""could reverberate beyond"" our Georgia lawmaker in question, considering ""similar constitutional challenges are pending against other Republican officials and could even be lodged against former President Donald Trump if he runs again in 2024,"" CNN reports.*

I don't agree with the professor, but he has a right to believe what he wants. 

If the roles were reversed, and the student was religious, and didn't want to address the professor by their preferred pronouns, since they pay to go there, are they free to refer to them how they like?

The way I see it, is all the same protections people have now, based on gender, sex,race, or religion, can be used both ways.

In this case, nothing that I've seen shows he was rude or bigoted in any way to the student aside from not following the requested pronouns, which he did state, according to this or maybe the linked article inside, that he told the school 2 years prior and the student, that he couldn't comply due to religious reasons. It did mention they discussed compromises, but not what they were. 

A gender neutral term, or just calling them by name seems simple enough. I don't know why that wasn't the solution, but unless I'm missing some important information, then it was all he did.

If that was the worst of it, and was very simply a matter of his religion, then what is the issue really?

If you're not religious, and I asked you to pray, you decline, I accept that we all move forward. In a perfect world that is.

In this case, aside from the simple compromise, (If you have anything with more detail on that, I'd like to see it so I know if I'm wrong, a lot of the articles seem to be a repeat of this one) it's like if I kept asking you to pray with me after you said no.  

On one hand, I could accept your answer and move on, on the other hand you could just pray to appease me, and we can continue.

Both sides could agree to disagree and thats it, but the student continued to complain and the teacher was threatened for not complying with something he didn't agree with.

At the end of the day, the same protections apply to both the student's gender and the professor's religion. They both chose not to acknowledge eachothers preferences, but only one was in fear of their livelihood over it.

Trans people are long overdue for equal rights, and should be recognized by their pronouns of choice, but in this case, doing so, would have made the professor, in his eyes atleast, compromise his own belief.",1

If the human reason for trans is self expression, then this is not at all in with animals exhibiting trans behavior; unless you would say that trans people become trans for advantages such as this (which i will assume you do not agree with).

I don't think threatening their livelihood is a good way to get them on board, and this is a good example of why.

I can't remember the exact reference, but it's been posted on Reddit multiple times. The gist is that a medical professor is discussing LGTBQ+ patients with the class. One of the students says something to the effect of ""well what if I don't want to treat a transgender person because it's against my beliefs?"" The professor says ""then find a new profession.""

College students are specifically paying for a service to be provided for them. The professor works for the college, sure, but they're also working for the student because the student is paying for that service (class). If the professor is too old and bigoted to accept a changing world then they don't need to work in a service industry that historically fosters and promotes intellectual debate and education. In short, the professor should find a new profession.",1

■ He planned and discussed various methods to try to overturn the election.

■ Her povided guidance and expertise to impeached former President Trump to assist in endeavors to overturn our government and destroy our democracy.

&gt;*John Eastman, a far-right lawyer for then-President Donald Trump who wanted to block his electoral loss in 2020, is still withholding about 3,200 documents from the House Select Committee investigating the January 6 insurrection, according to a new court filing this week. Eastman previously was ordered by the court to turn over 101 documents after he unsuccessfully tried to claim some of his emails from January 4 through January 7, 2021, were confidential legal communications related to Trump. Since then, Eastman has continued to work through nearly 100,000 pages of emails from his Chapman University account that the House Committee seeks from other dates around the election.*

No matter what John Eastman says and does? He __will answer to the courts__ and history, along with everyone else.

It __has come to light that certain government officials  Congressmen and Congresswomen__ have been supporting the January 6th Insurrection all along and they will be investigated.

Whatever hold pugnacious want-to-be dictator and former one term President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__ has over his cohorts, minions, co-conspirators, Congress, and others?

We have no idea. But eventually? Lady Justice will prevail.

Impeached former President Trump's minions / supporters have been referred for criminal prosecution to the Department of Justice (DOJ).

There have been 818 arrests (so far).  And growing. The January 6th insurrection was the __most documented crime in history.__

It is obvious as the investigation is moving forward that tactical planning, rehearsal, money, recruitment, equipment purchase, alternative facts, lies and more played into the attack.

Investigators __are doing their job.__

&gt;As throngs of pro-Trump supporters rammed their way into the U.S. Capitol on the afternoon of Jan. 6, two men sped toward the complex in a pair of golf carts. Roberto Minuta, 36, and Joshua James, 33, were on their way to aid a group of seven men and women who were preparing to climb the Capitol’s east stairs in a tactical formation, according to a federal indictment unsealed Apr. 1. To pierce the mass of people gathered there, each group member placed a hand on the back of the person ahead of them - a military-style tactic prosecutors called a “stack.” The group, clad in tactical vests, helmets and radios, forcibly entered through the Capitol rotunda doors, where James and Minuta followed 25 minutes later. “It’s going down, guys; it’s literally going down right now Patriots storming the Capitol building,” said Minuta, according to court documents. “F*cking war in the streets right now… word is they got in the building… let’s go.”

The article linked below highlights an extensive listing of arrested participants, with their name, state, charges, links to court documents, and notes.

&gt;*This table includes the names, charges, and links to court documents of all the people charged so far. We're keeping it updated as more names are released.*

The world will judge John Eastman, along with all other coup participants.

The most important observation about this article? Is that people are not going to wear masks and people are going to think that it's okay not to wear a mask.

Currently? Covid-19 and it's variants and  subvatiants are  on the rise.

The CDCs ability to fight for and protect public health has been hampered.

And it's all because an unqualified judge (who did not use scientific expertise) decided that masks were not necessary.",1

8135,It absolutely is not. And I do disagree with the fact Association that has a left-leaning bias.,1
8136,"Me too. With a passion.

I can't get into the emergency room or have surgery.

It used to be that if I needed surgery? My doctor would schedule it and I would have it within a week or two.

Now?

we're, talking many months. It's totally ridiculous.

Because all of the hospital space is taken over by anti-vaxxers and people who refused to wear masks. So they become extremely ill.

It's very upsetting for people who follow the recommended medical process, wear their masks and get vaccinated.

And then the antimaskers flood the hospitals because they never got vaccinated or never wore masks.

But boy __do they want medical treatment__ when Covid-19 arrives in their lives.

And often beg for the vaccination.

So someone who has a heart condition does not have that bed in the ICU. And they die.

While the person suffering from Covid-19 is taking up the ICU space, begging for that shot now.

But it's too late.


&gt;*A 43-year-old woman insisted “it’s just the flu” right up until she was begging to be intubated when oxygen masks failed to alleviate the panic caused by low oxygen levels. I pleaded with a 40-year-old man to accept my recommendations for care, only to have him grip my hand, look squarely in my eyes and say: “Feel my grip? I am strong. I am a man. Let me push through this.” (He went on to accept intubation but died several weeks later.)*

Acute patients are being transferred to other hospitals for care. Sometimes other hospitals don't have all of the trained personnel necessary for the care (dialysis). But because of the anti-vaxxers taking up space? That's actually happening. People are even being sent to other states. Hours and hours away from their loved ones because of a lack of space.

&gt;*Harrington Hospital tried to transfer Tsantinis again, but it was too late. A few hours before Tsantinis died, his daughter heard that Hartford Hospital in neighboring Connecticut would put him on its waiting list. By then, Tsantinis was too unstable to make the journey.*

Elon Musk was willing to pal around with Trump to a degree when it looked like Trump was willing to help in advancing the cause of moving away from fossil fuel vehicles, and when Trump was in charge of NASA (and could interfere with SpaceX), the FCC (and could interfere with Starlink), the NTSB (and could interfere with Full Self-Driving and Autopilot implementation), the SEC (and could interfere with Tesla), etc.  Elon Musk is definitely smart enough to suss out that Trump is a narcissistic borderline sociopath and know how to work around such a personality.

They basically told eveyone in America that voted that their vote did not count.

Because that is what they did. They basically came up to you, the American voter, and told you that your vote did not count because they have decided who won.

&gt;*What is a woman?*

Out of the *hours and hours* of testimony, that's __all you can come up with?__

If you follow the Senate Judicial Confirmation Hearings, like I do?

You would know that this question __has been asked of *every single judge / potential judge*__ that has appeared before the Senate Judicial Confirmation Committee.

But no one __seems to mention that__ detail in the fiery exploitation of the question - *what is a woman?*

Every single judge / potential judge appearing in front of the Senate Judicial Confirmation Committee has __answered the question__ same way.

*They __dodged__ the question.*

They have to.

Why, do you ask?

Because of the __types of cases that they hear or may hear.__

There can't be even a __shimmer of a doubt__ that a legal matter she may have to decide could show personal prejudice.

Judge Jackson (like any judge / potential judge) has to __really watch what she says.__ 

As you can tell from the hearings? There's a lot of animosity shown by the GOP towards Judge Brown.

&gt;*Transgender rights are dominating outrage on the right, after the Republican governors of Indiana and Utah vetoed bans on the participation of transgender women in women’s sports in recent days and a transgender swimmer, Lia Thomas, won a collegiate swimming championship.
Ms. Blackburn brought that swimmer up late Tuesday as Judge Jackson’s first day of questioning was coming to a close, then asked, “Can you provide a definition for the word ‘woman’?” As she and other judicial nominees before her have done regularly, Judge Jackson dodged the question as outside of her role on the bench, saying, “I’m not a biologist.”*

8940,"Many people are surprised to hear that, currently? There are __no Code of Ethics__ established for SCOTUS.

When you think about it? All federal judges have to adhere to a certain Code of Ethics.

&gt;*“Unlike all federal judges, Supreme Court Justices are not required to follow the Code of Conduct for United States judges - a binding code of ethics that ensures neutrality and transparency in our judiciary,” said Johnson, a former county magistrate judge.“The Supreme Court Ethics Act would change that by requiring the Judicial Conference of the United States to create a code of ethics, binding the Justices of the Supreme Court to common-sense standards that have applied to federal judges for decades.*

Democrats have submitted a bill for consideration.

We shall see what happens.

&gt;*U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and U.S. Representative Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) on Wednesday introduced the Supreme Court Ethics Act requiring the Judicial Conference of the United States to create a code of ethical conduct for the Supreme Court of the United States. U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), along with 15 other Senate Democrats, co-sponsored the legislation in the U.S. Senate. Murphy introduced the measure in the U.S. Senate and Johnson introduced companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives. Both members of Congress said judicial ethics ought to be a nonpartisan issue.*

IMO? It is long overdue. It should be non-partisan.

Perhaps __if SCOTUS adhered to ethical standards,__ like all other federal judges, then situations such as this would be better controlled or __even seize to exist.__

It's as __clear as the nose on my face__ that *changes need to be made.*

As far as lifetime appointments, re: SCOTUS? The __US Constitution has to be changed.__

It's the __only way.__

Term limits are *detailed* currently in the US Constitution, which is why the constitutional amendment process is the only way to change current term limits.

&gt;*Article III, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution reads that judges shall remain in their position so long as they follow ""good behaviour."" This has long indicated that judges, including Supreme Court justices, have lifetime tenure.*

There are 27 Amendments to the  US Constitution.The last Amendment took 200 years to ratify.

&gt;*With no time limit on ratification, the 27th Amendment was ratified in May 7, 1992, when Michigan approved it.*

There is a process in place to make amendments.The Constitution has been changed - many many times via amendments.That is why the process for change is in place. The amendments effectuate the change.They represent changes in our society and nation as we grow.

&gt;*Congress does not have the power to amend the Constitution. Congress does have the power to propose the amendment to the people and the States.*

Why oh why is the Republican Party paying for lawsuits so that a defense can be mounted for pugnacious want-to-be dictator and former one term President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__ at all?


Isn't he supposed to be a billionaire? And what does his business have to do with the Republican Party?


Can you imagine the uproar if the Democratic Party had paid for any of the lawsuits against the Clinton's?




&gt;The Republican Party has agreed to pay up to $1.6 million in legal fees to help former President Donald Trump fight investigations into his business dealings in New York, The Washington Post reported last month.



It's obviously they are trying to control what is going on. However? 


Using donations made to the Republican Party to pay for expenditures related to his business lawsuits (or __any lawsuits__) regarding Trump shenanigans? 


Seems like it might be a bad idea. 


At the very least.


IMO.



-&gt;“Here’s my question: Now that his kids have been subpoenaed as well, what do you think the odds are that Trump is going to figure out how to get the Republican Party to pay his kids’ legal fees as well?” Maddow asked on MSNBC Monday night. “Dad doesn’t have to pay his legal fees. Republican donors pay for those. But Ivanka and Don Jr. have to pay for their own lawyers? It seems so unfair.”",1

It's obvious to anyone that was watching on TV that day? Or looking at the evidence that has come out from over 300 + interviews by the January 6 Committee? That the attack:

■ was horrific

■ was strategically planned

■ was meant to destroy our democracy

■ was attended by current and former military and police, who instructed people what to do in terms of making sure they could make the most impact

■ was meant to hurt people, and worse

■ knew what it was trying to do as a group, and concentrated on that destruction 

■ was meant to interrupt a US Constitutional process

■ had no intent on stopping or disbursing 



As far as the insurrectionists were concerned? They were going to be there until they did what they needed to do.



&gt;Almost a year has passed since supporters of Donald Trump attacked the U.S. Capitol in a failed attempt to overturn his election defeat, the __worst assault on the seat of the federal government since the War of 1812.__ Four people died on the day of the riot. About 140 police were injured during the multi-hour onslaught by Trump supporters and four officers have since taken their own lives.

Pugnacious want-to-be dictator and former one term President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__ had his hands in it from day one. 

He has always been like that. It is part of his controlling behavior.



&gt;But it is worth noting that the New York Times recently reported that by early January, “the rally would now effectively become a White House production” and, with his eye ever on media production, Trump micromanaged the details. “The president discussed the speaking lineup, as well as the music to be played, according to a person with direct knowledge of the conversations. For Mr. Trump, the rally was to be the percussion line in the symphony of subversion he was composing from the Oval Office,” the Times reported.


The film shown before the riot was very much meant to anger the crowd and get them to do what he wanted them to do.



&gt;The goal of fascist propaganda is to mobilize a population to violently overthrew multi-party democracy and replace it with the leader.

There are a small number of seasonal jobs you can apply for, but that program is intended for recent highschool grads.  You work a low paying job and the benefit is you got to travel to Canada.  If you are young, you could look into it.  

But, Canada immigration enforcement is pretty lax.  If you overstay a visa, or cross the border outside of established ports, you will, presumably, be caught eventually.  You will get a court hearing, and can make your case in front of a judge.  This might take years. 

If you can show that you intend to stay, and that you are not a drain the social welfare state, your odds are good they will let you stay.  So, you would need to have a job, a place to live, etc.  

That's only the case currently.  If Americans start crossing the border in their 10's of thousands, Canadian judges and politicians may well change their mind and take a harder line on immigrants.  Fleeing to Canada has been in the back of my mind.  They might welcome such refugees, as much as they welcomed draft dodgers in Vietnam.

I was raised conservative and it was pretty much what I knew. I took for granted all the positions that I held because of course those were right, they'd what I'd always grown up knowing.

But as I came to terms with being trans I started to notice more and more terrible thing that conservatives do. It started with just ""well conservatives are anti-LGBT, so how do I reconcile being trans and conservative? So I did some research and looked at things like the log cabin republicans and libertarians. They had significantly better LGBT support so I was fine with continuing to call myself conservative and queer as long as I didn't support the mainstream republican party.

As I got older, I started to pay more attention to politics, especially with all the Trump madness. So I started to really read those political ads from the log cabin republicans. And they were abhorrent. Their basic platform is that gay rights are actually bad for gay people and we should just be happy with what we have. 

That message really resonated with me and made me think for a moment. Why was I supporting something that actively is going against what I want? 

This went hand in hand with my own transition. To really come to terms with your gender, you have to be able to objectively look at yourself and ask the question ""am I doing this because it's what I like doing and what fits me, or am I doing it because it's what's expected of me for the role I'm in?"" So this extends not only to your gender, but it leaks out into other parts of your life too. You take stock or everything you are and question why you're doing that.

And when it came down to politics, the only reason I had for believing what I did was because it was how I was raised and what I was used to. When I looked objectively at the policies that any form of conservative wants to implement, I found they didn't make sense. Their policies weren't helping people or making anyone's lives better. Sometimes, they were even actively making people's lives worse.

So, in summary, I couldn't actively support a group that hates me, and self reflection brought on by my transition led me to critically evaluate my views and came to the conclusion that conservatism doesn't work.",1

9186,"&gt; There is no ""gun show loophole"". It's just misinformation spread by Liberal media to scare you into believing something that isn't true.

I'll agree that it's a poorly used term to really speak about ""private sales"" as you admit is exempt from background checks. But it arguing over a term doesn't address the issue of unchecked sales. What would you think of a law that basically says, ""Sure, sell it without a background check, but if it's used in a crime and traces back to you, we charge you as an accessory?""

&gt; Why not 60 days? Why not 90? Why not a year?

Because even I feel that's too long, I think 30 days, with an expedited process for cases of immediate danger - which already exists in some states - could address that need. And, as someone who was witness to domestic violence growing up (not in my own home) I am definitely sensitive to that. But I'd argue that in cases where there is an immediate danger, there wouldn't be enough time to make a same day purchase and protect yourself; by the time the danger is at your doorstep, it's already too late.

&gt; I am open to that. In fact, I would encourage it. The problem is, there just isn't a way to do that.

Agreed, this is a tough one but one that certainly needs addressing, see above for a proposed solution.

&gt; However, I would not hesitate to share what I have with my neighbors should the need arise. Most gun owners are the same. We are prepared for the worst for a reason. If our government ever got out of control, it would be the gun owners of America stepping up to defend against tyrrany.

This I agree with as well and why I think some of these proposals aren't so far fetched, if something were to happen, guns would be shared and, in a case like that, they should be.

&gt; In the first few weeks the people of Ukraine had very little short of their personal weapons

True that people did, but Ukraine had a pretty well stocked army as well and within that first week weapons were already being sent in. (https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/06/us/politics/us-ukraine-weapons.html) I would also argue that it's still not comparable, in the case of shit hitting the fan here, especially if it was orchestrated from within, every city would likely be inundated with troops, not just a push one one front.",1
9187,"&gt; Mandatory background checks are only required for licensed dealers and interstate sales, not for private sales - which ""gunshow loopoles"" fall under.

This is incorrect.  Sure, a person can sell their gun to another person while at a gun show but they could do that at any time anyway.  If you are a licensed dealer (FFL) then you are required to do a background check on all gun sales even while you are at a gun show.  Just because guns are sold at a gun show does not mean that they are exempt from background checks.

There is no ""gun show loophole"".  It's just misinformation spread by Liberal media to scare you into believing something that isn't true.

&gt; Why not a 30 day waiting period on all weapon purchases?

Why not 60 days?  Why not 90?  Why not a year?  

What if someone wants to buy a gun to protect themselves?  I hate to say it but the most common example of this is a woman who wants to protect herself from an out of control ex.  Is she expected to live in fear for 30 days because she has to await approval to purchase her means to protect herself?  Perhaps she should just rely on the police who are only minutes away when seconds count.

&gt; Why not require ALL sales - including private ones - to require a background check?

All sales except private sales already require background checks.  If you have a method to enforce private sellers to do a background check, so be it.  I am open to that.  In fact, I would encourage it.  The problem is, there just isn't a way to do that.

&gt; Those who have guns won't be slaughtered by the thousands and those who don't probably won't be able to get their hands on weapons anyway.

I can't exactly speak for myself because I don't have an aresenal of guns.  I have what I need to protect my family and feed myself should the shit hit the proverbial fan.  However, I would not hesitate to share what I have with my neighbors should the need arise.  Most gun owners are the same.  We are prepared for the worst for a reason.  If our government ever got out of control, it would be the gun owners of America stepping up to defend against tyrrany.

Mandatory background checks are only required for licensed dealers and interstate sales, not for private sales - which ""gunshow loopoles"" fall under. They are technically private sales in just one big place so we can call it the ""private sale loophole if that makes you feel better. And ""liberal media"" has nothing to do with this; frankly I don't consume, specifically, one type of media nor do I vote single party, I tend to just vote for who I align with more. And I also like to do my own research when looking into something to understand both sides.

To be clear I am not advocating that guns be taken, nor am I advocating that they should not be purchased, I just don't understand the idea of trying nothing at a federal level. Why not a 30 day waiting period on all weapon purchases? Why not require ALL sales - including private ones - to require a background check?

To play out the ""China"" scenario, if it were to happen today, or tomorrow, how would that affect the average citizen to defend themselves? Those who have guns won't be slaughtered by the thousands and those who don't probably won't be able to get their hands on weapons anyway. I'd imagine firearms dealers would be the first places the be secured by any hostile force. But on the overall principle, I do agree, at least with a weapon you stand somewhat of a chance to survive - but not take back your country, so to speak. As I mentioned in another of my responses, it's why I'm considering purchasing a weapon, just to get my family to safety if anything does happen.",1

It's like when they show the electoral map and it's blood red except for a few blue blobs.

9346,"I was raised by a single mother (and partly by my conservative grandparents) in a *very* Republican home… Looking back, socially, I can see that the views in our home were fairly liberal when it came to social issues and abortion, but they were conservative in every other way.

Anyway, when I went to college, I identified as a Republican, in part because in my family, that’s just what everyone was.  I’m a millennial and so the adults in my life blamed the Clinton administration for everything… I got so used to hearing it that I didn’t ever question it.  Also, in our home, if you weren’t voting Republican, then it was almost as if you were defective in some way and that you were flawed.  To this day, my mom sees my newfound political views as a shortcoming and as though I’ve been tricked.  She doesn’t say it, but I can feel it.  It’s condescending as fuck.

After my college graduation during the economic recession, I was unable to get a job and ended up taking an unpaid internship in Chicago.  I worked a retail gig on the side to help pay for my transportation costs to and from my internship and lived with my aunt and uncle.  This was before the ACA, so I was also uninsured for about 3 years until I got a FT job with benefits.  I knew the state of things was terrible, but I still voted as a Republican because it was SO ingrained in me.  I attributed it to me not working hard enough or being good enough.

I got married in 2011 and was finally offered a FT job with benefits.  I had a baby in 2012 and at the end of 2014, I was being sexually harassed at my job and couldn’t go to work anymore without having physical symptoms of anxiety.  My husband wasn’t making a lot of money, but his work offered health insurance and our house payment was under $1200 so we squeaked by.  By this time, I had lived through circumstances that happened to me through no fault of my own.  I was a hard worker, I was educated, I was responsible, and yet I couldn’t understand why it felt like the universe was working against me.  

In early 2015, I became pregnant with my second child and the medical bills started rolling in and I quickly realized that we couldn’t afford them, despite the fact that we had insurance.  We had a $7000 deductible.  It was at this moment that I REALLY began to question the conservative/Republican rhetoric that “people who work hard don’t need government assistance”; I was embarrassed and ashamed of needing help, but quickly realized that the shame was the result of my conservative upbringing.  I also realized that a lot of people were in my same position:  Insured, but unable to afford healthcare. At this time, I was going through a political identity crisis and was afraid to express my thoughts and views to my family (my mom/siblings).

I was born and raised in Minnesota and around this time, Philando Castile had been shot and killed by a police officer in Falcon Heights in St. Paul.  Being raised in a Republican home, I was taught that *“if you don’t break the rules, you won’t get in trouble”*, but Philando Castile COMPLETELY complied with the police officer, to the point where he said he did have a weapon on him and he had a license to carry it.  Philando Castile followed all of the rules and obeyed the officers every request; he had been pulled over for a broken tail light.  I watched the video.  I saw it with my own eyes.  The officer shot him and he died.  I mentioned on my family’s text thread that the police officers were wrong to do that and it was shameful… That there was no reason for why that man was killed.  My family members said nothing.  

It was then that I truly realized how indoctrinated I had been in conservatism; I had remembered how scared I was to tell my mom that I had quit my job due to sexual harassment because she had previously said *“there are skirt chasers at every job… you just need to ignore it and move on”*.  I remembered how growing up, I was told that *”hard working people don’t need help”*, and yet here I was broke and full of shame.  I was told that *“people who respect law and order don’t have run-ins with police or the law”* and here was Philando Castile, killed for no reason.  I also realized that the vast majority of conservatives were against abortion, despite their stance that there should be “less government involvement overall”, except for when it comes to things like a woman’s right to make her own healthcare decisions.  

I FINALLY began to realize that conservative ideology was rooted in racism, sexism, and misogyny and I was SO embarrassed that I hadn’t caught on quicker… I still am embarrassed that it took me so long.

All in all, I attribute my political awakening to living life as an American woman and being faced by the lies and hypocrisy of the very ideas that I was raised to believe.  I was taught to believe certain things growing up, however life taught me that being taught to believe something is one of the first red flags.",1

If a person wants to hire two people, and one (white) has a college degree and the other (black) doesn’t, it makes sense they’d pick the former, and it has nothing to do with him being white. But Sowell does nothing to address the arguments against the inherited racial inequality that leads to black people as a demographic having less college degrees-things like worse public school systems, lower rates of home ownership from decades of redlining, etc. down to more minute things like sentencing disparities taking black parents out of the home longer than white parents.

9404,"Many people, of course, are quite well aware of the lacadorial behavior on the part of impeached former President Trump and his administration in regards to caring for America.

&gt;*In the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, as cases spread rapidly and deaths mounted, then-President Donald Trump threatened to withdraw help for governors who didn’t treat him “nicely,” and his aides barred the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from giving briefings for a staggering six months, according to a trove of new information released this week.*

Also? They seem to forget that emails, instant messages, etc., are available for preview now because Congress was given permission to review them. After __he fought tooth and nail__ to keep them away from the American public.

&gt;*Emails between top officials from the CDC and Trump administration, released by a House panel on Friday, also revealed that Trump aides strong-armed the CDC into watering down its public-health guidance for churches in May 2020, just as houses of worship were emerging as particularly risky settings.*

So they basically acted like they were the boss of everything. Like they were doctors or something and would not like to see DC do their job.

&gt;*In early May, the CDC released two reports, one of which detailed how a how a pastor at an Arkansas church and his wife unwittingly spread the virus to 26 others, which came to balloon into a cluster of 61 people, of whom four died. The second report found that 87 percent of attendees at a choir practice in Washington had caught the virus.The message, and accompanying recommendations that churches hold virtual or drive-in services only, was a stark contrast to Trump’s ridiculously rosy suggestion in April that the country should reopen entirely and be “raring to go by Easter.” Perhaps not surprisingly, when the CDC sent its draft guidance for religious communities to the White House on May 21, 2020, Trump aides immediately pushed back, the emails show.*

Just to be clear? Whitehouse aids and people who weren't scientists / doctors should not have control over public health policy or the CDC..

They should not be making decisions about public health policy at all.

It is disgusting to think about how many people died because twice impeached former President Trump didn't do his job.

&gt;*According to extracts of a forthcoming book by New York Times journalists Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns, obtained by The Hill this week, Trump went even further with governors, threatening to withdraw pandemic aid if they didn’t offer “reciprocity” or treat him “nicely.” The book, This Will Not Pass, “depicts Trump as a mafia don, demanding loyalty from supplicants and political opponents alike, by turns using the largest bully pulpit in the world to beat them into submission and cajoling them in private to offer support,” The Hill wrote.*

It does not surprise me that someone has written a book about these various incidents.

What would surprise me is the fact that people might pretend that they had no knowledge of this behavior, that it wasn't that bad or that it never happened.

Because when it was happening? At least in the PNW? We were well aware of what was going on.

&gt;*In one call with governors detailed in the book, Trump threatened to cut federal funding for most states that had deployed the National Guard to help battle COVID. He told them that if they wanted the federal government to cover the costs, “You have to call me and ask me nicely.” In another call with California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Trump said he would allow a COVID-addled cruise ship moored in San Francisco to dock so passengers could be treated—but he would be watching out for the reciprocity” from Newsom.*


Guilty __(at the very least) of supreme direlection of duty?__ The demagogic temerity of pugnacious and want-to-be fascist dictator / defeated one term President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__ and the imbroglio he has foisted upon our country *knows no bounds.* His cognitive dissonance moves forward unchecked.

&gt;*“President Trump’s comments, his rhetoric ,and his almost flippant attitude in some contexts made it difficult for a governor like me to really push the seriousness of the medical emergency that we’re in,” Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson told the book’s authors. Meanwhile, House Democrats also released excerpts of an interview with former CDC Director Robert Redfield on Friday in which he revealed the Trump administration blocked the CDC from giving public briefings, bar a few exceptions, for the first six months of the pandemic.*

The __freight train of Trump’s treachery__ still lingers, even after his failed __insurrection and miserably conniving__ attempts at *maintaining a stronghold on the GOP and the USA.*",1
9405,"Yep. In their minds, everyone who died didn't pull themselves up by their bootstraps.

Things like this are absolutely why Trump won in the first place, because stupid people will believe that Democrats are allowing illegal immigrants to vote and fuck middle class white guys’ wives while they’re at work.",1
9409,"The Supreme Court despite its conservative leanings has been relatively fair with respect to social Justice (that is until Trump and Moscow Mitch turned it into an illegitimate branch) but time and time again the conservative justices has 100% of the time ruled in favor for industry over working class. It doesn’t matter if they ruled in favor of gay marriage or LGBTQ rights, they continually rule in favor of the oligarchs. They allow the oligarchs to destroy America. Conservatives are what’s wrong with the world.",1
9410,I agree. Some SCOTUS decisions are way out of left field. They don't make sense.,1

And? When the damages incurred are emotional and / or psychological  it makes it even harder to take to court. Because you are exposing your vulnerabilities for the world to see.

But now to have SCOTUS claim that unless you have prove financial damage? You can't even bring the lawsuit?

That is chilling and disheartening to say the least.

&gt;*Dividing 6 to 3 along ideological lines, the Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that victims of discrimination that is forbidden by four federal statutes may not sue if the only harm was emotional distress.*

This is what happens when Republican judges are the SCOTUS majority.

They care about businesses.

Not people.

Many many times people suffer emotional or psychological abuse, but no economic damages.

This court has just ruled that unless you suffer economic damages? Forget about it. No lawsuit or potential damages for you.

&gt;*“But the court’s decision today allows victims of discrimination to recover damages only if they can prove that they have suffered economic harm, even though the primary harm inflicted by discrimination is rarely economic,” Justice Breyer wrote. “Indeed, victims of intentional discrimination may sometimes suffer profound emotional injury without any attendant pecuniary harms. The court’s decision today will leave those victims with no remedy at all.”*

From your user name, I have to assume that you are trying to be funny.

Yes. We all know what the fee of up to $2,800.00 will cover (everything Disney currently pays for now - all emergency services, security, trash removal, salary for 400+ people, benefits, retirement, and other things, etc.).

But it doesn't matter.

A __one billion dollar bond__ has to be paid off before the district can be dissolved.

&gt;*Disney's Reedy Creek Improvement District (RCID) recently said that Florida can't terminate the district unless the state pays off Reedy Creek's $1 billion debt, fulfilling the state's pledge to bondholders per a 1967 act. Reedy Creek currently has around $1 billion in extensive bond debt, according to Fitch Ratings, a credit rating agency. Reedy Creek argued in a statement, posted to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board on April 21, that Florida pledged to the District's bondholders that ""it will not limit or alter the rights of the District.""*

It's in their contract. You can't change a contract unless both parties agree to it in writing.

Like I have mentioned previously?

If Gov. DeSantis had lawyers who specialize in this type of thing __read the contract?__ They would have told him that.

I don't think there is an extra billion dollars. Just laying around.

On top of all of the other money Florida residents would have to come up with.

IMO? This legislation could just disappear into the night. It is an embarrassment.

Or they could fight about it for years in Court, long after this particular governor is out of office.

But whatever happens? The people of Florida will suffer either way because they will have to foot the bill.

CRT isn’t taught in Virginia. It’s a college concept. 

No one is teaching students to be guilty for being white or to be a victim for being black.

Generational wealth is nonexistent in most minority families because we would either A) “Red line” their properties, B) give them subprime loans, C) systemically jailed the breadwinner of minority families in the 80s. D) Public schools are underfunded since anyone with wealth will move to the county moving taxable income out of public school budgets. 

Please look up the history of redlining minorities, mortgage rates for minorities, for profit prison models that get states to promise a prison population of 90% capacity which has lead to time and time again of Judges receiving kickbacks from jailing blacks.

There is a reason the median white family owned 184,000 in wealth, 23,000 for black, and 38,000 for Hispanic. 

Italian is still white in most peoples books. I have 100% white people in my 12 person IT department. Black people only apply for our low wage contracting jobs like dietary and cleaning vs white people are applying to our paper/registration positions. 

Also, a majority of college sport scholarships are given to white people for sports like golf, water polo, softball, lacrosse, etc

3. The ""Greater Good"" is a myth. Really it's just rich white people trying to make themselves feel better about a problem they made up and they don't actually care about the health of other people. 

Putting all that together, the article makes the claim that we shouldn't compell anyone to take the vaccine because it perpetuates colonialist power structures and empowers rich white people at the expense of the health of poor African people.

That mirrors my own thoughts. I've got a buddy who says that he is anti-statist, and he's often made the remark about the fact that regular Joe Schmoe isn't allowed to own a functioning tank. Or APC. Or anything else that goes **big boom**. While you *can* get a license to own some very restricted types of guns or equipment, 99.99999% of the US population would have zero capability to even put a dent in an armored vehicle of any sort with the sorts of weaponry that is regulated for civilian purchase.

Do I think that the average American citizen should be allowed to own a rocket launcher or armored vehicle that shoots explosive rounds? Of course not, but not being allowed to own those things certain puts the American citizenry at an astronomical disadvantage against any standard US army platoon of soldiers. So it's really a moot point, in my opinion, for anyone to argue that they need their guns to protect themselves from a tyrannical government.

""Ask the soldiers who fought in Afghanistan and Iraq about how effective small arms fire was"" was the response I got, as if I had suggested that a 5.56 civilian-model rifle was equivalent to a bb gun.

You do NOT need military weapons for self defense when you can use a handgun. 

60 Minutes has shown how destructive of the AR-15 ammunition when shot at a human person at the high velocity using the AR-15 rifle provides. 

[Why do mass shooters choose the AR-15 style rifle?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weG-QtQx2-0)",1
9624,"I know it’s beating a dead horse, but military style assault weapon is a pretty loose term in today’s world. Military style- are you referring to the cosmetic/functional external features of the weapon such as flash suppressor/pistol grip/foregrips? These affect controllability of the weapon and not really lethality of the bullet itself. There’s an argument to be made that it allows quicker and more accurate follow up shots but in the context that gun control is largely being talked about (mass shootings) these weapons are used on dense crowds of people where “spray and pray” is the most typical means of employment. These accessories don’t make the physical bullet itself do any more or less damage. If you’re talking select fire (the gun can be selected for safety, semi automatic, fully automatic/burst), very very very few private citizens own these types of guns. The military uses select fire for their m4s exclusively so calling it military style in this case would also be wrong. 

Assault weapon- a term that can mean a lot of things based on what definition you’re using. Some definitions say it must be select fire, some say semi automatic firearm, some say semi automatic rifle. Saying it’s select fire is odd because the militaries of the world are pretty much the sole users of select fire, and they don’t call them assault weapons. Semi automatic firearm is also ridiculous because that means it includes handguns and shotguns so that’s another level of absurdity to an already absurdly broad and ill defined/agreed upon definition. Saying semi automatic rifle has become the de facto use in the media, but you can make almost anything a rifle by attaching a rifle stock to it. I think if anyone is going to ban anything there needs to be a logical and Lear definition on just what it is that is being banned and I do not have faith in any politician to do this as they get it wrong constantly. 

As for that specific group not having a reason for owning whatever weapons we are in fact talking about, I don’t agree with that either. There’s a lot of development that occurs in those three years and they shouldn’t be second class citizens based on their age. I think there is something to be done but if you can own a home you should be able to protect it and your family using whatever is legal. If someone seeks to do myself or my family harm, I would want to have at least equal firepower to what they might be bringing to the table. 

Again, not saying that there shouldn’t be some rules put in place but sweeping statements and vague definitions do nothing to get us there.",1
9625,"I'm going to sound glib, but you underestimate the value of cosmetics. 

People buy the AR-15 because they want to pretend to be military, and it makes their pp hard to get all tacticool. As long as the military is still using the M4 and similar weapons, that's what inexperienced shooters with delusions of grandeur are gonna want to buy.

__Judged by the Company One Keeps__

One night in late October,

When I was far from sober,

Returning with my load with manly pride,

My feet began to stutter,

So I lay down in the gutter,

And a pig came near and lay down by my side;

A lady passing by was heard to say:

""You can tell a man who boozes,

By the company he chooses,""

And the pig got up and slowly walked away.

It seems to imply that one can mount a defense so long as you were ordered to commit the wrongdoing by some authority. To me, this doesn't make sense so long as the person ordering the wrongdoing isn't found guilty of the wrongdoing.

Personally I think this defense should only be available to people for whom the ""authority"" is found guilty of the crime. This would encourage flunkies to give evidence against their bosses.

Elon wants Twitter for the data. He can use the cover of free speech. It's a great cover.",1
9717,"Let me get this straight:

- he becomes a majority shareholder, the stock price rises (pump)
- he does NOT dump
- he then proceeds to publicly demonstrate why Twitter is a failing company, further tarnishing the company's reputation
- he continues to hold ALL of his shares while he drags the company through the mud more and more
- Twitter prepares a poison pill specifically for this one man, which would flood the market with devalued shares and inevitably deflate the company's long term value and investor confidence.

That is not a pump and dump. He's literally de-pumping it while he still owns his shares. He either wants to own the company or wants to assist in its self-destruction.",1

9740,"That was such a gross read. I had a few takeaways:

She quotes James Madison and his ideals as if he was the sole founder of the US. Luckily for us sane Americans, we can obviously conclude that Madison held these *personal* views, and luckily they were not written into law, which means bringing up his views and using them to defend her claims was obsolete. James Madison is dead in the ground and his viewpoints were not made into law, full stop.

Bringing up the founders of America is really really a tired argument, from everyone, but even here. We live in a highly advanced society that the founding fathers could not have even imagined, dreamed, written about, or experienced. Their viewpoints on the state of the world and country are outdated and, again, obsolete. She is beating a dead horse. 

She names all of these things she suspects are happening that are not, or are single-digit-case scenarios that do not represent the actual telling. There aren’t teachers bringing up sexual topics to students outside of a sex-ed setting.

Correct me if I’m wrong, but school counselors also have to follow confidentiality laws, which state they are not allowed to discuss anything a student has confided to them *unless it is deemed as an immediate danger to the student or others.* Obviously, Ms. D’Avola has no idea what she is talking about when it comes to that councilor sheet she pulled out. I know that the “Can’t Say Gay” laws in Texas and Florida (and other places) are trying to make it to where admitting to being transgender or LGBT+ identifying is considered “immediate harm” to the student, but as far as I know, that is not the case at all in Colorado.

&gt;*An appeals court on Thursday will debate whether a congressional committee can obtain former President Donald Trump's tax returns from the U.S. Treasury Department, the latest face-off in a three-year old legal fight.*

Impeached former President Trump is consistently appealing decisions so that he can prolong outcomes and control the narrative.

&gt;*Trump is appealing a lower court decision from December 2021 that determined the Democratic-led committee chairman has broad authority to obtain a former president's tax returns.*

Impeached former President Trump was the __first president__ to do many things. Some unimaginable in years past.

&gt;*Trump was the first president in 40 years not to release his tax returns as he aimed to keep secret the details of his wealth and the activities of his family company, the Trump Organization.*

&gt;*A federal law empowers the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee to request any person’s tax returns from the IRS. Invoking that statute, the committee sued in 2019 to force disclosure of Trump's tax returns.*

Impeached former President Trump has tried, __unsuccessfully and continously,__ to stop his tax returns from being released.

So I don't really think he __has a chance of stopping the release this time.__

&gt;*The U.S. Supreme Court last year cleared the way for a Manhattan prosecutor to obtain Trump's tax returns from his accounting firm, but that ruling did not directly affect the Ways and Means Committee's case.*

It really __makes him look pathetic.__ It makes people think he's trying to hide something. Which? __Obviously? He is.__

9846,"[Sydney J. Harris](https://wesodonnell.medium.com/patriotism-vs-nationalism-whats-the-difference-5e23db662a3) best sums up the difference between patriotism and nationalism:

&gt;“The difference between patriotism and nationalism is that the patriot is proud of his country for what it does, and the nationalist is proud of his country no matter what it does.”

&gt;A nationalist believes that his country is the best because they live in it. But a patriot believes that his country is the best but there is always room for improvement.

&gt;A nationalist can’t tolerate any criticism of his country and considers it an insult. But a patriot can tolerate criticism and have a thoughtful conversation about improvements.

James Boswell on Samuel Johnson:

&gt;Patriotism having become one of our topicks, Johnson suddenly uttered, in a strong determined tone, an apophthegm, at which many will start: ‘Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel.’ But let it be considered, that he did not mean a real and generous love of our country, but that pretended patriotism which so many, in all ages and countries, have made a cloak for self-interest.

&gt;*A defense lawyer has explained why so many of Donald Trump's former executive assistants can't be located: they won't return his phone calls.*

For some reason? They are having problems finding 12 secretaries that should be interviewed in regards to this probe.

It's highly suspicious to me.

&gt;*New York Attorney General Letitia James demanded that Trump make his former secretaries available as she winds up her 3-year investigation of the former president's real estate and golf resort empire. She wants them to swear out affidavits explaining the process they used to organize and preserve Trump's personal business records, scant few of which have been produced for the AG's probe. ""It is striking that counsel could not locate any of Mr. Trump's 12 former executive assistants,"" AG Special Counsel Andrew Amer had said in court papers on May 23.*

Are we are expected to believe this?

&gt;*But most of the 12 missing former executive assistants had not responded to voicemails or failed to call back as promised, explained the latest filing in Trump's battle against James' document subpoeana.*

Are we seriously supposed to believe that someone who worked in the capacity as a secretary for a billionaire had no document tracking / retention methodology in place?

Strom Thurmond, died Monday, her family’s spokesman said. She was 87. Washington-Williams kept her father’s identity secret until six months after Thurmond, a segregationist leader for decades, died in June 2003 at age 100. “I never wanted to do anything to harm him or cause detriment to his life or to the lives of those around him,” Washington-Williams said at a 2003 news conference, six months after her father died at the age of 100.

She kept it a secret.

&gt;An attorney for the former senator’s family confirmed in 2003 that Thurmond fathered a child with a teenage black housekeeper in 1925. Her mother, Carrie Butler, worked as a maid at the Thurmond family home in Edgefield, South Carolina.

Actually? We know the tax issuance to the public is voluntary. But __it is a tradition.__

&gt;From temperament to professional background, Former President Donald Trump didn't exactly fit the mold when it came to occupants of the Oval Office. One other area where he defied presidential norms: refusing to release his federal tax returns to the public. That veil was finally lifted when The New York Times got hold of two decades’ worth of Trump’s filings, showing paltry $750 tax bills in 2016, the year he was elected, and in 2017, when he assumed office, in part due to massive business losses and controversial write-offs. Given Trump’s unwillingness to release this information, it’s ironic that the whole tradition of sharing tax filings with the public started with another president who got into hot water over his generous deductions: Richard Nixon.


I guess if I was a billionaire and I only paid $750 in taxes (by the way I pay a lot more more than that) then of course I wouldn't want it released to the public. 


But he must've figured that eventually people would find out?


What did he think would happen? __I for one find it very upsetting.__


Presidential candidates are legally required to file a “Personal Financial Disclosure” with the Federal Election Commission. 



&gt;Today, the President and Vice President released their public financial disclosure reports. The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 requires high-level federal officials to publicly disclose their personal financial interests on OGE Form 278. The public filing system serves to prevent financial conflicts of interest by providing for a systematic review of the finances of government officials. Those finances are set forth in annual disclosures, which are reviewed and certified by the independent Office of Government Ethics. Neither the President nor the Vice President have any conflicts of interest.


And he was, lets say, influenced by alternative facts.


Like? Fantasy land.

And now look where we are.


Trying to recover from his abhorrent admistration.

It will take years to recover - it will not happen overnight. 




&gt;New York Attorney General Letitia James disclosed new details Tuesday night about her civil investigation into former President Donald Trump’s business, saying the probe has uncovered evidence suggesting the company put fraudulent values on multiple assets and misrepresented those values to financial institutions for economic benefit.
James, who launched her investigation in 2019, also said in the court filing that the former president “had ultimate authority over a wide swath of conduct by the Trump Organization"" that involved fraudulent misstatements to financial institutions, the IRS and other parties. She specifically mentioned the responsibility of two of the former president’s adult children, Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump. “Since 2017, Donald Trump, Jr. has had authority over numerous financial statements containing misleading asset valuations,” James wrote in the court filing. Ivanka Trump, a former White House adviser, “was a primary contact for the Trump Organization’s largest lender, Deutsche Bank,” James wrote. “In connection with this work, Ms. Trump caused misleading financial statements to be submitted to Deutsche Bank and the federal government.”

However?

We are getting there.

&gt;Speaker Pelosi (D-Calif.) has directed House Democrats to draft a bill to ban members of Congress and their senior staffers from trading individual stocks, Punchbowl News reported Wednesday.

So you’re saying that by virtue of being a public servant you lose the right to privacy in your own home? What other rights do you lose? Is that all public servants or just elected ones?

In Vittitow vs UA the court struck down the protest ban. The issue wasn’t the subject of the protest.

If you’re protesting directly in front of my house you take that right from me. Most these cases involve anti-abortion protesters outside doctors house. 

I haven’t read the wording of this law yet. It may very well be overreaching. I can’t tell just based on that article. My point is that laws of this type aren’t always unconstitutional.

Most of the people here agree that GOP economic policies are disastrous and don't help those in the bottom nor do they lift our country out of poverty. What they do is consolidate wealth to the 1% leaving the rest of us to scrape the bottom of the barrel. Finally there was no impact on oil prices from the shutdown of the pipeline. You know where there was impact that was when the pipeline on the East Coast was hacked and that was shut down by foreign actors. Something the Trump administration should have been aware of and fixed since it had been vulnerable for years.

Even before pugnacious want-to-be dictator and defeated one term President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__ took the oath of office? It was quite clear that he lacked (even) general knowledge of the USA an the world at large.


His ability to comprehend and maintain facts, or discern between incomprehensible logic and the truth, was ludicrous.

Talked about, even. Within the corridors of the West Wing and throughout the world.

&gt;Donald Trump arrived in the White House so ignorant and unprepared for his new job that senior aides had to explain, among many other things, that Finland is a country. It was that ignorance which created opportunities for his daughter, Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner, to make vast fortunes.







Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner made a lot of money during their time in the White House, supposedly working for free and trying to help our country and the world) become better.


 

&gt;They walked into unpaid jobs at the White House with very troubled finances. They walked out having made at least $172m from outside activities – and possibly as much as $640m. During his last year on his father-in-law’s staff, Jared also set up a holding company in a Caribbean tax haven.



There is a profound link between autocracy and corruption. One of the things that autocrats do?  They push back against anybody or anything who could ensure accountability.


Time and again?

Including suggesting the death penalty to former opponent Secretary Clinton ( who has been investigated thoroughly).

On top of everything else? 

Former President Trump is using alternative facts to try to get around the issue of submitted evidence regarding his personal and business activities.

&gt;Former President Donald Trump said in a court filing Monday that he ""denies knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth"" about his company's finances.

A former president of the United States of America has suggested the death penalty for Secretary Clinton (for what exactly)?

No one says or really does anything about it. 

&gt;A day later, he issued a blistering 1,100-word statement in response to his longtime accounting firm Mazars USA dropping the Trump Organization as a client and claiming it could no longer stand by a decade's worth of tax documents. Trump waxed lyrical about his company's ""fantastic assets"" and said prosecutors should consider giving Hillary Clinton the death penalty instead of investigating the Trump Organization's finances.

The President Trump says one thing in a court filing and then the next day he says something totally different. 

It's like deja vu all over again.

Please tell me this is not __our new normal.__ 

This type of rhetoric from a former President is a bad message to send to the world.

__Basically? He is saying:__

*I'm mad that you are investigating me and that the courts moving forward with the investigations / cases. Therefore? I'm going to bully and destroy anyone I want to so that I can draw away attention from what is going on with my businesses and family court cases. Especially people that I feel are not 100% loyal to me and my ideology *

&gt;The former president has been privately pressing Wyoming’s governor to change state election laws to deny the congresswoman Democratic support.

It __should not be a law__ that when you go to the precinct to vote or vote via mail, that you have to vote for the party that you are registered with.

That you __have to vote__ all Democratic, Republican, Independent, etc.

I think that is *wrong.*

&gt;On Thursday, Trump endorsed Wyoming legislation that would prevent crossover voting in a primary election. Were the law to pass, Democrats, Republicans, or independents would no longer be able to switch party affiliation on the day of the state’s primary to vote for a candidate in another party.

In America? 

You __should be able to vote__ for whoever you want. Even if it's __different than the party you are registered__ with.

And it doesn't matter what type of election it is. Whether it is a primary election or not. I want to be __able to cast my vote__ for the person that speaks to the needs of our community the most. 

I think this is a very dangerous precedent that is being encouraged by former President Trump and others.  

It should not be allowed to happen.

No.

Whether they work in Washington, DC or their home state - it counts as work.

In actuality? 


People are often confused regarding Congress and how much they actually work.

&gt;There is a great deal of misunderstanding about how much congressmen actually work due to the fact that there are often fewer legislative days than working days in the calendar. This leads people to believe that members of congress work much less than them and enjoy leisurely recesses spanning a month at a time, but this is far from the case.


Some congressmen can't afford a house in their home state and a house in the Washington, DC metropolitan area, so they sleep in their offices so that their families can still live in their home states.

They work. Just like anyone else.


&gt;A legislative day extends from one adjournment to the next. The House normally ends its business at the end of a day and adjourns, so its legislative day generally corresponds to the calendar day. The Senate often recesses, rather than adjourns, at the end of the day in order to avoid certain required routine business that begins a new legislative day. Thus, the Senate's schedule can be made up of a handful of legislative days even when it has been meeting for several months.

They don't go on vacation just because they're not meeting in Washington, DC for that particular session, for example.



They may be in their Congressional Offices, on official travel, or in their home state offices.


__Working.__


There are 365 days in a year. The US Congress works just like all of us works. 


Although?


I have to admit? During the last administration? Because of the work ethic of the last person that lived in the White House? A lot of people were confused about when the government was on and when the government was off.





&gt;The life of a lawmaker is about more than just the number of days scheduled to cast votes. ""In session"" legislative days make up only a small portion of the duties of congressmen.


They still attend meetings and take care of  the business that has to do with the running of the country.


&gt;No matter where they are or what they are doing, House and Senate members are spending 83-85% of their time—and well over 40 hours a week—on legislative/policy work, constituent services, political/campaign work, press/media relations, and administrative duties.

And the days in session for the House of Representatives and the Senate are often different.

So? Do people might think or have heard or even believe that the only work half a year or something like that? In reality? It is a full-time job. Whether it is in Washington DC while they are in session or at their home states. 


It's all considered part of the job. 



They don't just leave the session in Washington DC and then go on vacation. 


They are, because of the US Constitution, obligated to still work and adhere to the duties of taking care of our country.

POTUS does not go on vacation just because Congress is not physically in session in Washington, DC.

Oftentimes, Congress has to rush back to Washington. DC in reaction emergencies or something that's going on. 


They often keep a couple of people there for that purpose - just in case something happens to our country. 


So never believe that Congress is only a part-time job. 


Whoever tells you that? They have either been misinformed or they have not researched it.

My people Slavics had it worse than any race on planet earth, worse than Native Americans, worse than Jews, worse than African Americans, worse than Hispanics.   Mao ruling over the Chinese are the only other people who have been oppressed as bad.   The etymology of the word slave came from Slav.   Slavics were some of the first known slaves under the Ottoman Turkish empire for hundreds of years.  Rapped and pillaged, boys were castrated and forced to fight in the Turkish army against their own people.  Girls as young as 8 were forced in sex slavery.   This went on for hundreds of years.  The KGB was started by Jews and slaughtered millions of my People and forced them into Gulag slave labor camps.  Mothers babies were ripped out of their wombs.  Horrible horrible atrocities took place in Russia worse than anywhere on Earth in human history.  Do we complain about it?  You never even heard of the Holodomore famine which starred to death killing well over 5 million men woman and children ?  Yet you hear about the Holocaust every school year rammed into your brain.  

CANCEL CULTURE STEMS FROM COMMUNISM.

Under Stalin in Russia the central state encouraged children to spy on their own parents and report them if they had any anti Stalinist thoughts.   The NKVD would then and come take the parents away to the Gulag and the children raised by the state.   (Sound familiar to cancel culture much?).

__Congress has not had a raise since 2009.__

Members of Congress (consisting of the *Senate and House of Representatives*), __make the same salary.__


&gt;The compensation for most Senators, Representatives, Delegates, and the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico is $174,000. The only exceptions include the Speaker of the House (salary of $223,500) and the President pro tempore of the Senate and the majority and minority leaders in the House and Senate (salary of $193,400). These levels have __remained unchanged since 2009.__

Here is some additional interesting information.

The US Constitution determines how Congress is paid. The __amount that they are paid__ is determined by Congress, of course.

&gt;Article I, Section 6, of the U.S. Constitution authorizes compensation for Members of Congress ""ascertained by law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States."" Adjustments are governed by the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 (2 U.S.C. §4501) and the 27th Amendment to the Constitution. They generally take effect in January.

If the people of the USA want this to change?

An amendment to the US Constitution would have to be approved.

__The last amendment to the US Constitution, Amendment 27, took 202 years to ratify.__

&gt;In 1982, the Amendment was languishing before the states with only a tiny fraction of the number of states needed to ratify having ratified it. That year Gregory Watson, a sophomore at the University of Texas, was assigned to write a paper about a government process. He came across a chapter in a book on the Constitution, listing proposed constitutional amendments that had not been ratified. He wrote his paper on the congressional pay amendment, arguing that there was no time limit on when it could be ratified, and that it could be ratified now. He got a C on the paper. Maybe if he had received a better grade on his paper, the story would have ended there, but Watson was sure it was a better paper, so he appealed his grade, first to his T.A., then to his professor; and when he was unsuccessful, he decided to take the issue to the country. In an NPR report in May 2017, he said that after his teacher affirmed the C, “I thought right then and there, ‘I’m going to get that thing ratified.’”

So he did.

&gt;The Archivist of the United States declared the Amendment to be legally ratified, and, subsequently, Congress on May 20, 1992, declared the ratification to be legal and the Amendment to be part of the Constitution.  As of today, forty-six states have ratified the Twenty-Seventh Amendment while four have not.

I stupidly thought that Trump would be seen as a carpetbagger and not trusted by the very religious, highly suspecting idiots in my family... but I grossly underestimated how much hate really does trump (no pun) pretty much everything else, emotion-wise. 

When I was puzzled back in the early aughts by southern love for GWB (""That's a guy I could have a beer with!!"") I tried to point out that the man really would have nothing to do with the unwashed masses he courted for power. Now, that personna seems quaint and almost harmless in comparison.

10669,"&gt;Look, there's a difference between being negligent just plain cruel... manipulating the people to pay for their own death is almost artful.

Nail on the head; I'd suggest that it *is* an artform at this point. I mean, let's be honest... politicians know exactly what they're doing, and Republicans specifically know what they're doing. It's just bizarre that it works to the degree that it does on so many voters.",4
10670,"Because they don't link rising cost of living and asking for a raise as being related.

For them, rising gas prices means that ""the government"" whatever nebulous person they want to blame for that, is ruining the economy and hurting the common man. So the solution is obvious, to them at least. The government needs to get out of people's lives so prices can go back down. So they support Republicans who promise to get government out of people's lives.

But for asking for a raise, they see it as greedy. For them, when you ask for a raise, you're asking to get more from doing the same thing. You're asking to work no harder and get something even more. In their minds, you're asking for the system to be broken and to get extra money you didn't earn. They'd rather you take on extra hours because then they'd see the more money you received as being earned. 

It falls back to Republicans believing that everything should be earned and that anything you get that they believe you didn't earn yourself is cheating the system and putting down all the other workers. They believe that if the government just stopped with all these social programs or people stopped begging for raises they didn't deserve, then taxes could be lowered and businesses could lower prices, thus meaning they'd get to keep more of their money, effectively getting a raise.

It's a very odd world view, but it makes at least a hint of sense when you put yourself in their shoes.",5

10673,"You used the term ""rational person"" which isn't exactly the base you're speaking of, at least not politically. For some, it's all about ""getting the other side"". For others, it's all about aligning yourself with whomever promises to fullfill your craziest fantasy (creating a Christian Nation). How else do you explain how the Christian Right still identifies so much with Trump; an *objectively* immoral, lying, cheating, elitist pig that they normally would decry as an example of the degredation of values and morals in America, yet stand by him in the face of his crimes against their own beliefs?

Politicians learned long ago how to appeal to the smaller, less rational and more emotional arguments that matter most to the base: ""abortion, gun control, Jesus in schools, gay people are scary"" and then just run all over them policy-wise with tax cuts on the wealthy, no regulation for their morally bankrupt financial friends, etc etc. 

Scott is the perfect example: Remember in 2015 when he argued that welfare should be restricted to people who can pass a drug test? Then it was shown that he benefitted directly from doing said tests?

10678,"Romney, for me, represents a good look at what the Republican Party should be: a group of conservative, controlling, white, male, and wealthy people controlling a flock of conservative, white, controlling people who believe in god, lie about whether they drink, and stand for cultural norms and policies I don't agree with... but are not fucking crazy. 

Mitt Romney may be a lot of things I don't agree with and don't like, but the man is at least within an inch of reality. He's educated and doesn't believe in denying where common sense and learning meet (as evidenced by his rejection of science denying anti-vaccers), more interested in the rule of law than despotism (as evidenced by his critcism of Trump) and at least willing to play by standards and rules of decency, for the most part.

He ran against one of the most divisive incumbant presidents among white people... maybe ever... and did not stoop to grotesque levels of Trump running against a woman. He may be a Mormon, but he didn't bang adult film stars, pay them to shut them up, sue them to keep them quiet... all while being married and a father (that we know of). I mean... can we please go back to hating on Republicans for being square, un-hip, rich white dudes that may believe in sky daddy, but at least also get their fucking shots?

I don't consider myself retarded. 


It's sad that you think attacking me personally like that will somehow make the events of January 6th disappear or seem less than what they are.


Actually? I have traveled all over the world, for work and pleasure. 


Traveling all over the world enables you to explore and enrich your soul, to interact with other people - to see how they live and how they think. 


It really shapes you and helps you become a better human being. 


I have actually met / talked to people who have never left their cities / states. That's pretty dismal to me. I think that can really affect how you perceive yourself, your surroundings, and the world at large.

In order for a wound to heal? You have to name it. You can't run from it. 


You have to say what it really was. 

Vice President Pence wrote:

&gt;My oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not.

A gallows was built to hang him.

President Biden said:

&gt;The will of the people was under assault. The Constitution, our Constitution, faced the gravest of threats,"" he said.  The ex-president ""tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power"" and a ""violent mob reached the Capitol,"" Mr. Biden said. ""But they failed,"" Mr. Biden said. Members of law enforcement ""saved the rule of law,"" the president said. ""Our democracy held. We the people endured. We, the people, prevailed,"" he said.

It's beyond politics. 


&gt;“I work every day with people who refused to authorize an investigation of an armed insurrection at our nation’s Capitol that ended up in the deaths of people who were defending us,"" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). ""That’s a kind of a disagreement that goes beyond policies or home-state interests.""

Felonies were committed tjat day.

&gt;... federal law makes it a crime to engage “in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States or the laws thereof.” Someone who violates this statute faces a fine and up to 10 years in prison.

People all over the USA, in our government, and all over the world have recognized the insurrection for what it was.

It is the worst attack on the seat of our government.



■ It's the capital of our nation. The seat of power.


■ The chamber the insurrectionists attacked? It's where all of our laws are made.  

■ It's where decisions are made about what's going to happen to our country. 

■ It's where they ensure the US Constitution is adhered to, especially in regards to electing the President of the United States.

■ It's where discussions are held about the disbursement of funds.

■ It's where legislative offices - where our wlrxted officials have their offices.

■ It's where discussions are held regarding policies and guidelines regarding our government.

■ It's where the State of the Union Address is held. Where our president gets up in front of the world and tells everyone what has been happening in the last year. And what the plans are for the future.

■ it's where the debates are held.


I could go on and on. 


If you have ever walked those hallowed halls and gone on tours, like I have? You really would understand the importance of our  US Capital. The history and changes that have taken place within those walls.



__It is the seat of power.__ And anyone who can't see that? Is not going to school.


Or has not researched the subject. Or read articles. 


Witnesses have come forward and said that they saw Republicans leaving the chamber before announcements were made to leave. As if they knew what was happening. Witnesses have Elsa come forward to say that Republicans gave tours and showed people wear certain legislators offices were located. This is all come out in evidence so far. The evidence that Mark Meadows and others gave to the 6th January Committee.


&gt;In an interview with BET.com, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas recalled the moment she realized she and her colleagues were at risk. She said she already sensed an uneasiness when Trump supporters arrived at the Capitol following a rally by the former president. But then she watched Republican lawmakers scuttling from the House chamber. ""I even asked myself out loud, where are they going?"" Jackson Lee told BET. ""At the minute that my mouth moved … I saw or heard the shouting from the cloakroom. It was the sergeant-at-arms saying to close the chamber doors and at that point people in the chamber began to gather their belongings and flee.""


IMO?


You can't really heal from something unless you know what it is and you name it. We have to do that in order for our nation to heal. We can't just sweep it under the carpet. We can't pretend it never happened or pretend it was not as bad as it was.




&gt;Mr. Biden told reporters after his speech that the way to heal is to ""recognize the extent of the wound. You can't pretend. This is serious stuff. You've got to face it. That's what great nations do."" 

I watched the attack happen. It was horrendous.


&gt;Mr. Biden told reporters after his speech that the way to heal is to ""recognize the extent of the wound. You can't pretend. This is serious stuff. You've got to face it. That's what great nations do."" 

Years from now? When our children start asking questions about this incident. I want to be able to tell them that I did everything I could to keep people informed and let people know what really happened. 


I want to be able to say truthfully that I recognized what happened and I knew how horrible it was. I want to have proof out there that says I said and did something.



I'm doing what I can to make sure that the world never forgets what really happened. And that it's not swept under the carpet or downgraded into something else like a tourist event that one of our legislators called it recently. A tourist event just like others that have occurred.



And I have to tell you. I have been on those tours. And what occurred on that day? Was not like any tour I had ever attended in my life.


&gt;""The violent insurrection of January 6 was a day that will live forever in infamy, a permanent stain in the story of the American democracy and the final, bitter, unforgivable act of the worst president in modern times,"" Schumer said.


Edit - Added a statement from VP Pence and a link to the timeline of 6 January. Also. I use voice to text and I had to fix some areas where voice to text did not work correctly.

With redistricting now finished in just over half the states, a misleading narrative has emerged that the gerrymandering hasn’t been all that bad. By focusing on one narrow fact — that the overall distribution of seats between the parties might not change much — this story misses the full, much grimmer picture.


To be sure, new maps might not significantly increase seats in the near term for Republicans (who already enjoy a large advantage as a result of aggressive gerrymanders of the 2010 maps). But the maps remain deeply pernicious gerrymanders — and, in many ways, are even worse than before. By shoring up last decade’s gerrymanders, line drawers have breathed new life into distorted maps and ensured that elections in 2022 and beyond will be skewed, uncompetitive and deeply biased against voters of color.


With a showdown on the Freedom to Vote Act and John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act coming this month, it has never been more urgent that Congress act. Just ask voters in North Carolina and Texas. Under the congressional map passed by North Carolina’s Republican-controlled legislature, Republicans could win 71 percent of the state’s congressional seats with only 48 percent of the statewide vote. Republicans in Texas have engineered similar advantages. Texas Democrats would have to win 58 percent of the vote to be favored to carry more than 37 percent of the state’s congressional seats. In other words, Texas could turn a dark shade of blue and Republicans would still have a two-to-one seat advantage. That hardly looks “not so bad” for Democrats.

It’s important to remember that gerrymandering isn’t just about gaining new seats — it can also be about insulating the seats you already have from competition. And one of the biggest redistricting stories this decade is how competition is being sucked out of our elections, especially in Republican-controlled states.

Again, consider Texas. Under the old Texas congressional map, there were 11 districts that Donald Trump won by 15 points or more in 2020. Under the new map, 21 of 24 Republican districts will be such super-Trump districts. Overall, in four of the most gerrymandered Republican states (Ohio, Texas, North Carolina and Georgia), the number of heavily pro-Trump districts will go from 27 to 39 after redistricting, an increase of 44 percent. (The number of super-safe Biden districts also goes up by three in these states as a result of Republican packing of Democratic voters.)


The “not so bad” narrative also, exasperatingly, turns a blind eye to the impact of the redistricting cycle on communities of color, who account for nearly all the population growth in places such as Texas. In state after state in this round of redistricting, Republican map drawers, in particular, are not only refusing to create new electoral opportunities for minority communities, in many cases they are actively dismantling them.

Take, for example, the redrawing of maps in Texas’s Fort Bend County, outside Houston. Historically, almost all of the suburban county had been included in the 22nd congressional district. But the county, which was 62.6 percent White in 1990 became just 32 percent White by the end of last decade, and its politics had become increasingly multiracial. In 2018 and 2020 in the district, Indian American Democrat Sri Preston Kulkarni ran strongly in defeat at the head of a diverse coalition. To make the seat safe for Republicans, the Texas legislature carved up the 22nd, shoving heavily Asian communities into an adjacent district and bringing in largely White, rural communities. Rather than competing for the votes of a multiracial America, Republicans are undermining it with an attack on the power of suburban communities of color.

Democrats, of course, are not above gerrymandering. In Illinois, and possibly in New York, Democrats are moving to entrench their own power, though, nationally, Democrats control line drawing for only 75 seats compared to the 187 that Republicans control. Happily, a handful of states have moved away from extreme gerrymandering. In Michigan and California, independent commissions produced fair and competitive maps that represent the changing country. These wins brighten the national picture, but we shouldn’t let them obscure the gerrymandering that continues to threaten democracy in many states.

The Freedom to Vote Act and the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act would prevent extreme partisan gerrymandering and strengthen protections against racial discrimination. Both have passed the House and command majority support in the Senate. President Biden stands ready to sign them into law. The only obstacle is the filibuster — a legislative tool that has been used too often to thwart civil rights and racial equity legislation. It is critical that the Senate not let this Jim Crow relic stop needed reforms.

Sure, the cycle could have been worse. But Americans deserve better than an “it could have been worse” democracy",1

They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.”

Guilty of __at the very least, supreme direlection of duty?__ The demagogic temerity of pugnacious and want-to-be fascist dictator / defeated one term President Trump __(the only president to be impeached twice)__ and the imbroglio he has foisted upon our country *knows no bounds.* His cognitive dissonance moves forward unchecked.

The __freight train of Trump’s treachery__ still lingers, even after his failed __insurrection and miserably conniving__ attempts at *maintaining a stronghold on the GOP and the USA.*

Twice impeached former President Trump's rallies continue to __spread hatred and lies,__ unabated. I believe 100% in freedom of speech.

I __can't remember a time in history__ when a modern former president has *participated in and supported* such disruption and lies since leaving office.

Once again? The Michigan rally on 02 April 2022, where U.S. Rep. Lisa McClain spoke, is a case in point.

*Imagine* this scenario?

A __current representative in our US Congress__ has sipped so much Trumpland Kool-Aid, that she has is __convinced that Osama Bin Laden was captured__ during the Trump Administration?

I read these headlines with mouth agape. I would like to know what the audience at the rally __was thinking?__

Were they __convinced when President Obama__ was in office, that the capture of 
Osama bin Laden __never took place under his leadership?__ Did they think it was a __memory from some imaginative movie they binge watched__ on a streaming service?

What about our *Navy SEAL Team Six* and every *single person and entity* that participated?

&gt;*Michigan Congresswoman Lisa McClain falsely claimed during a Saturday campaign rally that Osama bin Laden had been caught by the Trump administration.*

Does anyone ever fact-check anything before they go on stage in a Trump Cult rally?

&gt;*During her remarks, McClain also said unemployment is at a ""40-year high"" while there is ""a labor shortage.""*

Or do they read written crap prepared Trump's minions? Some titillating Michigan Gas the fact and fiction to confuse the listener?

The current unemployment rate is the __best it has been in 20 years.__

&gt;*The current unemployment rate is 3.8%, down from a record of 14.7% during the height of the pandemic and lower than it has been for most of the last 20 years.*

There's nothing new here. It's the same old crazy word salad from the guy who __summoned his cult to attempt a coup.__

11133,"I think the distinction is more about respecting precedent and legal frameworks. It’s common for decisions to follow a political theme but respect long-standing precedent and legal norms. Recent decisions see us straying from that to what some call “legalism” — an overtly political outcome using legal dressing, but ignoring both precedent, norms and existing legal theories. Unfortunately, if you look up legalism, you’ll see the type of political systems where it’s most popular. 

The long-term down side to legalism is that it impairs the credibility of the Court. That credibility is what gives weight to implementing decisions even when unpopular with the current administration or the public. As SCOTUS popularity decreases along the lines of Congressional popularity, and some decisions (appear to) stray from moral, legal and ethical standards, it risks more than credibility: it increases the potential a more authoritarian-minded executive will feel empowered to ignore a decision.

This isn’t a purely liberal concern. Conservatives from Scalia to Roberts have voiced concern about this. And if that rubicon is crossed, SCOTUS becomes little more than a rubber stamp on the executive.",1

&gt;*When U.S. District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle tossed out the federal government's transportation mask mandate on Monday, she relied in part on her interpretation of the term ""sanitation."" The 10-letter word can be found in the Public Health Service Act, a sprawling 1944 law that gave the federal government certain powers to respond to public health emergencies.

Legal experts clearly state her interpretation of the law is incorrect.

&gt;*Legal experts say her interpretation missed the mark. ""If one of my students turned in this opinion as their final exam, I don't know if I would agree that they had gotten the analysis correct,"" said Erin Fuse Brown, a law professor at Georgia State University. ""It reads like someone who had decided the case and then tried to dress it up as legal reasoning without actually doing the legal reasoning,"" she added.*

I agree. The ramifications are far reaching and will encourage the spread of the disease.

&gt;*""The reasoning is poor, but it also has really drastic and dire consequences for public health, which is the part that makes it not just a joke, but it actually makes it really frightening,"" she said.*

Judges are not supposed to substitute. Her inexperience and lack of knowledge of how federal agencies work comes through very clearly.

&gt;*Mizelle substituted her own definition of ""sanitation,"" Hodge said, brushing aside a legal norm known as ""agency deference"" that compels judges to yield to the interpretation of federal agencies when a law's language is unclear. 

Mizelle's ainexperience, and the fact that she has been declared not qualified by the ABA to serve in this position? Really comes through in this opinion, IMO.

&gt;*Hodge said she misunderstood how the federal government operates during a national public health emergency. ""This is really a serious deviation from not just what we're trying to do to protect the public's health, but a misstatement of federal authority in emergencies to a great degree,"" Hodge said.*

&gt;*The Trump administration notified the American Bar Association (ABA) on March 17, 2017, that the group would no longer receive special access to background information on judicial candidates prior to their nomination. A letter to the ABA from White House Counsel Donald F. McGahn II said that all organizations would receive the background information in equal fashion. In so doing, the Trump administration became the second consecutive Republivsn administration to eliminate the ABA’s special access.*

The __freight train of Trump’s treachery__ still lingers, even after his failed __insurrection and miserably conniving__ attempts at *maintaining a stronghold on the GOP and the USA.*

&gt;*The ABA began rating nominees to the judiciary in 1956, during the administration of President Dwight Eisenhower (R). Bush and Trump were the first two presidents since then to opt against granting the ABA special access to candidates’ background information.*

It's unbelievable to me that someone who is rated unqualified by the ABA would still be able to become a judge.

I listened to every single second of the Congressional hearings in regards to Judge Jackson’s nomination.

Including testimony ABA in regards to her qualifications.

It's a unfathomable to me that someone deemed unqualified was allowed to go through and is now serving on the bench.

Even though the ABA said they were not qualified.

&gt;•* Steven Grasz, a nominee to the United States Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit;*

&gt;•* John O'Connor, a nominee to the United States District Courts for the Northern, Eastern, and Western Districts of Oklahoma;*

11320,"
I would watch the rallies of impeached former President Trump and I was often reminded of cult like behavior.  That's why I used phrases like - they drink his kool-aid in my posts and write-ups.

It was specifically said to remind people of the behavior of people when they were around him. 

&gt;*Speaking at an April 21 seminar at Georgetown University's Center on Faith and Justice, Raskin spoke about how he was worried about the mental health of some of his colleagues in Congress. He singled out controversial Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's heckling of him in April, noting how her disruptive behavior almost got her removed from the chamber.*


No matter how outlandish his lies? He was believed and praised.  Worshipped.


&gt;*Rep. Jamie Raskin says he consulted with cult deprogrammers to learn how best to interact with extremist fellow lawmakers.
Speaking at an April 21 seminar at Georgetown University's Center on Faith and Justice, Raskin spoke about how he was worried about the mental health of some of his colleagues in Congress. He singled out controversial Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's heckling of him in April, noting how her disruptive behavior almost got her removed from the chamber. ""I'm really concerned about what it does to people to feed themselves on lies. And I do think they're acting much more like members of a religious cult,"" Raskin said. He added that he has been ""consulting deprogrammers to try to figure out"" how to talk to these colleagues and ""pull them away"" from their extreme beliefs.*

It's interesting that Rep. Raskin was given the same advice that someone might be given to help somebody experiencing a mental health crisis.

&gt;*""Basically, the deprogrammers say you have to be as warm and affectionate and as personable as you can be with them and make them remember what life was like before they got into the cult,"" Raskin said.*

I would have liked to be a fly on the wall to witness this conversation.

&gt;*Rep. Raskin said that he had personal conversations with some House members as well and told them how they needed to wake up from their cult-like behaviors or lose it all. ""I've told some of them - I'm like if you guys don't get out of this, all you're going to be fit for when it's all over is only selling incense and flowers at Dulles Airport,"" he said. ""You'll end up sleeping on the floor and listening to tapes all night,"" Raskin added. ""Because they've abandoned critical thinking skills."" 



Those are really strong words. However? When you think about it? Something has to be said to get through the Kool-Aid. To get through the stupor that they Ttumpies find themselves in. Caught up in the rapture of Trumpism.


No matter how many lies Trump's tells and no matter how outlandish the lies our? He is still believed. Even with audio, video, written test, documentation, Twitter, and everything else in between. Even with evidence right in front of their eyes they still deny everything. And that is sad. However? That is cult like Behavior. And it will continue until they leave the cult or start figuring out that some of the things that he says are pretty apparent and full of alternative facts - lies.

His new tax policy only helped his rich friends. He purposefully had it written so that __changes that help the rich__ are there forever, and changes that he put in to help regular people __actually expire soon.__

&gt;*Many of the tax benefits set up to help individuals and families will expire in 2025.*

Which means that tax liability *will rise for us regular folk.*

&gt;*One of President Donald Trump’s lesser known but profoundly damaging legacies will be the explosive rise in the national debt that occurred on his watch. The financial burden that he’s inflicted on our government will wreak havoc for decades, saddling our kids and grandkids with debt.
The national debt has risen by almost $7.8 trillion during Trump’s time in office. That’s nearly twice as much as what Americans owe on student loans, car loans, credit cards and every other type of debt other than mortgages, combined, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. It amounts to about $23,500 in new federal debt for every person in the country.*

11394,"It becomes more and more clear that the Trump White House was full oh so full of bravados and no substance.

One of the main things we can to push back against autocracy is to heal our system at home.

It's actually the same battle.

&gt;*Former federal prosecutor Glenn Kirschner believes former President Donald Trump and his former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows ""wanted the Capitol to be taken"" on the day of the insurrection last year.*

In order to make American democracy work, we make it work.

&gt;*Donald Trump, Mark Meadows, and others in Donald Trump's administration deprived the Capitol of the federal law enforcement forces it needed to defend itself,""  Kirschner said in a video posted to YouTube on Friday. ""And that, friends, leads to one pretty compelling inference. We can maybe even call it the only reasonable conclusion: That Donald Trump and Mark Meadows wanted the Capitol to be taken; that Donald Trump and Mark Meadows the angry mob to stop the certification of Joe Biden's win.""*

There is a profound link between autocracy and corruption. One of the things that autocrats do, is they push back against anybody who can hold them accountable.

Whether that is the media, courts, prosecutors, inspector generals, whichever institution there in the civil service or the legal system.

They push back, they mock them, make fun of them, take away their influence (power). Because they want to get away with breaking the law themselves.

&gt;*""And that, friends, leads to one pretty compelling inference. We can maybe even call it the only reasonable conclusion: That Donald Trump and Mark Meadows wanted the Capitol to be taken; that Donald Trump and Mark Meadows the angry mob to stop the certification of Joe Biden's win.""*

They are simultaneously undermining democracy and the rule of law.

It's not an accident that those two things go together.

&gt;*In December 2020, Reps. Matt Gaetz, Jim Jordan, and other Republican lawmakers participated in calls and meetings with Trump and his aides after he lost the 2020 presidential election, according to testimony given to the committee by Cassidy Hutchinson, who served as an aide to Meadows. Hutchinson said in the deposition records that various Republican lawmakers, including Gaetz, Jordan, Reps. Scott Perry, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Louis Gohmert, either met in person or dialed into meetings discussing ways to undo Biden's victory.*

Pushing back against those practices, forcing even our highest leaders (such as current / former presidents, congress members and cabinet leaders) to meet the consequences of their actions (just like other society members) is what it means to be a democracy.

&gt;*During these meetings, the Republican lawmakers explored avenues that ""could potentially be a constitutional and viable option to either stall certification of the election or to delay the inauguration or to assert that Mr. Trump had actually won,"" Hutchinson said. Other political figures agree the testimony so far has been shocking. For instance, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, who serves on the Jan. 6 House panel, said the testimony brought forth before the panel will ""really blow the roof off the House.""*",1

They introduced an alternative law and thought this one went too far, so they won't be voting yes on it. So there goes any hope of a majority in the Senate.

That’s one twice changed rule which may take three decades from start to finish to see its final form. 

I’m not trying to suggest aborting fetuses with already developed neurological systems or ones which are underdeveloped but ultimately leaving decisions to a specialist and mother leaves far more room for flexibility in abnormal cases. Besides doctors have shown time and time again that hospital needs certain flexibility to work. Unless certain decisions can be made in the room the patient would suffer while doctor would be put under legal liability for sometimes sound decisions that don’t look right on a legal paper.",1

I definitely think people should be seeking out birth control and realizing it’s importance if they are sexually active and if anything I’m frequently aghast at people on social media who perpetuate myths about birth control and make all sorts of claims it’s bad for you. I know it’s maybe not for everyone and it can have side effects but so many people I see on the internet pushing fallacious information about it aren’t even medical professionals and are just making up myths. So I think there absolutely should be safe discussions on birth control and more birth control awareness and it would help alleviate need for abortion",1

Then again, SNL also had Trump host the show well after he had already said and done lots of problematic shit.

I left Facebook simply because I had no use for it and Twitter is an echo chamber at best and a shithole at worst. If Elon Musk truly wants to make sure Twitter supports free speech, he's gonna have to let all opinions go. I don't necessarily see him favoring one set of ideals over another, but if he allows Trump back, will it even matter? 

The lying, misinformation, bigotry, and overall garbage coming from all sides never stops. Every single opinionated SOB with internet access is gonna find a way to spread their bullshit. Twitter is just the most popular platform at the moment. People can flood the feed with quick bite-sized posts, because we all have short attention spans and no interest in making verifying what they believe. 

I left Twitter today, simply because I'm exhausted by all the constant information about unchecked corruption and privilege overtaking all aspects of society and how there's nit much that can be done about it. I'm numb to all of it, so I'm done wasting my time on Twitter. I'm more or less ready to leave here as well.

I've grown apathetic to so much of what's happening. I'm in no position to do anything. As a straight white male, I'm irrelevant, even if I'm trying to argue on behalf of those who are different from me. I'd rather let those directly in the line of fire, be the ones to speak their truth. If I were to go back to Twitter, it would only consist of me RTing every news article, op-ed, and any other bit of information that is trying to expose corruption. 

Unfortunately, as I said, Twitter is an echo chamber.

Their relentless efforts at privatizing state mental health and prison jobs did no favors for the public; rather, it was a ploy for them to gain “a piece of the pie” for themselves through currying favor with wealthy special interests (e.g. private prison industry). 

When Governor Bob Martinez (remember 2 live crew’s song “F*ck Martinez”?) was in office, I remember he called state workers “a bunch of lard bricks.” Soon thereafter, he was inundated with lard bricks sent through the mail from state workers everywhere.

Also, Republicans’ stances on issues like abortion, the environment and military spending seemed increasingly out of touch with a reality that every day people were experiencing. For me, being a Gen X’er, witnessing the social aftermath of the Vietnam war was an especially influential experience. It would be a cold day in hell for me to join the military (or Republican Party for that matter) after hearing about all of the deception, suffering and heartbreak that took place during my father‘s generation. Although it is true that Kennedy and Johnson (both Democratic politicians) played significant roles in determining the disastrous outcome of how Vietnam unfolded, I found that Republicans tended to more likely “tow the Party Line” than most Democrats I knew on these types of issues. 

It was firsthand experiences like this while growing up that solidified my evolution toward the left part of the political spectrum. I first had to recognize who was on my side.

You said:

&gt;Sure, but a lot of low premium ACA plans also carry high deductibles. Private health insurance plans—including government-sponsored ACA plans—with (a) a low premium, (b) a low deductible, and (c) robust coverage are virtually non-existent. Unless you have (non-ACA) group health insurance that is heavily subsidized by your employer, you’d be extremely lucky to find health insurance that has two of those features, let alone all three. Edit: ask your neighbor what their deductible is.

States that *did not seek Medicaid expansion* don't have the same programs / options available as states that did. It __really depends__ on what:

Probably, what does this have to do with taking Twitter private though?

I also find this argument strange given Jack Dorsey. It would seem having clearly insane leadership didn't harm Twitter in the past so what's the issue now?

Given the cost of entry is very small why does this pose a problem if your assumption of he is going to break Twitter is true?

&gt; The only arguments I ever hear in favour of him are “well x/y/z is worse,” which even if it was true (extremely debatable) that still isn’t a very persuasive argument in his favour.

The polarization of politics is getting increasingly worse and one of the most significant drivers of this in recent decades is social media. Social media results in views being expressed in echo chambers due to both algorithms ensuring you only see things you agree with and moderation pushing people in to more extreme echo chambers.

People should be engaging with ideas they disagree with. Echo chambers result in people believing their own views have greater support then they do and without challenge the self-belief in views only grows.

There are only really two outcomes at this point;

* The US will cease to exist. The quality of governance and policy has declined dramatically, eventually it will reach the point where the federal government simply can't function.
* We begin to engage, collaborate and compromise with those we disagree with again.",1

Most dramatically, Fillmore’s bill would require the legislature to hold a special session after an election to review election processes and results, and to “accept or reject the election results.

&gt;*Former President Donald Trump made governors flatter him personally for federal aid after natural disasters ...*


The __freight train of Trump’s treachery__ still lingers, even after his failed __insurrection and miserably conniving__ attempts at *maintaining a stronghold on the GOP and the USA.*

&gt;... Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, a Republican, said Trump told governors who wanted aid: ""You have to call and ask me nicely."" Hogan claimed that Trump had a policy in which only Texas and Florida, two states with governors Trump considered close allies, would be given federal aid when needed without question.*

I distinctly remember this happening. I also remember that everyone was overwhelmed with all of the unbelievable treachery coming out of the white house. So that when you added one more abhorrent treachery to the pile?

it was hardly noticed.

&gt;*Governor Ned Lamont of Connecticut, a Democrat, recounted a similar experience, The Independent reported. Lamont said he asked the White House for assistance in obtaining federal disaster aid after a storm in August 2020 left parts of Connecticut without electrical power. He was surprised when he received a call from then-President Trump himself hours later, who said: ""There's something you want me to ask about FEMA?"" When Lamont replied that he wanted to ask about FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) aid, Trump reportedly said: ""Well, ask me nicely.""*

Hatred, anger, and kiss my ring we're such normalized functions of the Trump Administration. People that were cognizant of these issues and wrote about them were practically ignored because there was so much coming out of that Administration that was disgusting.


&gt;*The governor told the book authors that he felt like Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during the infamous 2019 call in which Trump pressured him to investigate Joe Biden while withholding vital military aid.*



I remember thinking to myself that the federal government is supposed to help every single person. Not just people that impeached former President Trump liked or felt they were receiving appropriate amounts of glittery and butt kissing.

&gt;*Tump has long had a reputation for demanding and rewarding devotion to him. As president, he publicly demanded that governors show deference to the administration during the COVID-19 crisis, saying, ""I want them to be appreciative.""
He also implied that he told his Vice President Mike Pence not to take calls from state executives that ""don't treat you right.""*

It was bad when it happened.

It was bad that no one made a big issue out of it, because they were used to all of the crap coming out of the White House.

It is bad now that we have to relive it through all of the testimony that's going to come out and all of the books that will be coming out for years and years and years.

Because? People will come forward. People will write books. And people will tell their story to anyone who wants to listen.
